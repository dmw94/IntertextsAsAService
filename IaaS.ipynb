      "בראשית ברא אלוקים, let the “intellectuals” realize that all the words of our sages and their interpretations are true and accurate. This is what the Talmud (Shabbat 63) had in mind when it quoted Rav Kahane saying that he had studied the Talmud until the age of 18 and had not yet appreciated that although the laws of the Torah are derived from the text, none of the interpretations are such that they can uproot the plain meaning of the text. They are based on anomalies in the text, not on the text itself wherever the law derived from the Torah appears to conflict with the plain meaning of the text. One example is Genesis 2,4 where the word בהבראם, a most unusual construction, used by the sages to declare that the world was created “for the sake of, or with the help of אברהם,” (Bereshit Rabbah 12,9) seeing that the letters in that word are the same as the ones in the name אברהם, [though in a different sequence. Ed.] I shall list the explanations of earlier commentators of old, in order to demonstrate why I did not follow in their footsteps. Some scholars understand the first verse to mean that “at the beginning G’d created heaven and earth.” This is an erroneous explanation, seeing that water preceded the creation of heaven and earth as we know from verse 2 where “the spirit of G’d” is described as already “hovering over the surface of the water.” Moreover, the Torah did not write בראשונה, which would have been appropriate if it had wanted to tell us that heaven and earth preceded all other phenomena in the universe. The word בראשית is in a construct mode, as in Genesis 10,10 ותהי ראשית ממלכתו בבל “the mainstay of his kingdom was Babylon.” A construct mode like this cannot describe the commencement of something but refers to something already in existence. As to the scholars who understand the word as equivalent to the word תחלה in Hoseah 1,2 i.e. so that it would mean “at the beginning G’d created the heaven,” i.e. before He created heaven and earth there was chaos, darkness on the face of the water, etc., so that it emerges that water had been created first, this too is nonsense. How could the Torah refer to a state of the earth prior to creation of the heaven? The plain meaning of the text is, as occurs many times, that something may be mentioned first in one instance although elsewhere this same phenomenon is mentioned as having occurred at a later stage. In Genesis 9,18 we are told about the three sons of Noach who left the ark after the deluge being Shem, Cham and Yephet, and the Torah adds that Cham was the father of Canaan. Although the information about Canaan is quite out of place at this juncture, the fact that later on the Torah tells us that Noach cursed Canaan, makes it necessary to mention him here, as otherwise we would not have known who this Canaan was whom Noachh cursed in verse 25 of the same chapter. We have a similar situation in Genesis 35,22 where, although Reuven’s conduct with Yaakov’s concubine Bilhah is mentioned, Yaakov’s reaction is not mentioned until shortly before his death when he explains why Reuven had not been viewed by him as suitable to occupy the position normally accorded to a firstborn (Genesis 49,3-4). In 35,22 the Torah already tells us that Yaakov had heard about what Reuven had done. Had the Torah not done so, the reader would have been taken aback at Yaakov’s remonstrating with Reuven at this late stage. There are many such examples. Our entire paragraph here was written by Moses in order for us to understand what is written in the Ten Commandments concerning the reason why the Sabbath is holy, i.e. that it is a symbol reminding us of the fact that G’d created the universe in 6 days and rested on the seventh day. (Exodus 20,10) If anyone were to think that the universe as such had already existed then in the format that we see it now, the Torah corrects such thinking by continuing with \n",

      "IN THE BEGINNING G-D CREATED. Rabbi Yitzchak said: The Torah, which is the book of laws, should have begun with the verse, This month shall be unto you the first of the months,1Exodus 12:2. which is the first commandment given to Israel.2It is true the book of Genesis contains three commandments (1:28; 17:10; 32:33), but after the Revelation on Sinai these laws became incumbent upon Israel. Hence the verse this month, etc., is “the first commandment given to Israel” as a people. What then is the reason that it begins with the creation? Should the nations of the world say to Israel, “You are robbers because you took unto yourselves the lands of the seven nations of Canaan,” they [Israel] may reply to them, “The whole world belongs to the Holy One, blessed be He. He gave it to whom He pleased, and according to His Will, He took it [the land] from them and gave it to us.”This is a homiletic exposition3Found in Tanchuma (Buber), Bereshith 11. See also Rashi (Berliner) p. 424. as quoted by Rabbi Shlomo [Rashi] in his commentaries.One may object that it was indeed very necessary to begin the Torah with the chapter of In the beginning G-d created for this is the root of faith, and he who does not believe in this and thinks the world was eternal denies the essential principle of the [Judaic] religion and has no Torah at all.4A person who thinks the world is eternal cannot believe in miracles since, if G-d did not create the world, He cannot possibly change it. Ramban explains in many places (e.g., see further, 17:1; 46:15) that all Divine promises concerning the blessings or imprecations which will follow upon our observance or disregard of the Torah are miraculous in nature of “invisible miracles.” A person who believes that the world is eternal thus has “no Torah at all.” See further my English work, Ramban: His Life and Teachings, Chapter 13.The answer is that the process of creation is a deep mystery not to be understood from the verses, and it cannot truly be known except through the tradition going back to Moses our teacher who received it from the mouth of the Almighty, and those who know it are obligated to conceal it.5Chagigah 11 b: “The process of Creation may not be expounded before two.” It is for this reason that Rabbi Yitzchak said that it was not necessary for the Torah to begin with the chapter of In the beginning G-d created and the narration of what was created on the first day, what was done on the second and other days, as well as a prolonged account of the creation of Adam and Eve, their sin and punishment, and the story of the Garden of Eden and the expulsion of Adam from it, because all this cannot be understood completely from the verses. It is all the more unnecessary for the story of the generations of the flood and of the dispersion to be written in the Torah for there is no great need of these narratives, and, for people who believe in the Torah, it would suffice without these verses. They would believe in the general statement mentioned to them in the Ten Commandments: For in six days the Eternal made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day,6Exodus 20:11. and the knowledge of the process of creation would remain with individuals as a tradition from Moses who received the law on Sinai together with the Oral Torah.Rabbi Yitzchak then gave a reason for it. The Torah began with the chapter of In the beginning G-d created and recounted the whole subject of creation until the making of man, how He [G-d] granted him dominion over the works of His hands, and that He put all things under his feet;7See Psalms 8:7. and how the Garden of Eden, which is the choicest of places created in this world, was made the place of his abode until his sin caused his expulsion therefrom; and how the people of the generation of the flood were completely expelled from the world on account of their sin, and the only righteous one among them — he [Noah] and his children — were saved; and how the sin of their descendants caused them to be scattered to various places and dispersed to different countries, and how subsequently they seized unto themselves places after their families, in their nations,8Genesis 10:5. as chance permitted. If so, it is proper that when a people continues to sin it should lose its place and another people should come to inherit its land, for such has been the rule of G-d in the world9The Hebrew word ba’aretz (world) may also refer here to “the land,” especially the Land of Israel. See Ramban further, 26:5. from the beginning. This is true all the more regarding that which is related in Scripture, namely that Canaan was cursed and sold as a servant forever.10Genesis 9:25. It would therefore not be proper that he inherit the choicest of places of the civilized world. Rather, the servants of G-d — the seed of His beloved one, Abraham11See Isaiah 41:8. — should inherit it, even as it is written, And He gave them the lands of the nations, and they took the labor of the peoples in possession; that they might keep His statutes, and observe His laws.12Psalms 105:44-45. That is to say, He expelled those who rebelled against Him, and settled therein those who served Him so that they know by serving Him they will inherit it, whereas if they sin against Him, the land will vomit them out, just as it vomited out the nation before them.13See Leviticus 18:28.Elucidating the explanation I have written are the words of the Sages in Bereshith Rabbah, wherein they say as follows:141:3. “Rabbi Yehoshua, of the city of Siknin, in the name of Rabbi Levi opened [his discourse on this chapter of Creation with the verse]: He hath declared to His people the power of His works.15Psalms 111:6. Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, reveal to Israel what was created on the first day and what was created on the second day? It is on account of the seven nations who inhabited the land of Canaan, so that they should not taunt Israel and say to them: ‘Are you not a nation of robbers?’ Israel could then reply to them: ‘And you, is it not booty in your hands? Have not the Caphtorim that came forth from Caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead?16Deuteronomy 2:23. The world and the fullness thereof belong to the Holy One, blessed be He. When He willed it, He gave it to you, and when He willed it, He took it from you and gave it to us.’ It is this which Scripture says, To give them the heritage of the nations.15Psalms 111:6. He hath declared to His people the power of His works in order to give them the heritage of the nations. Hence He told them the account of creation.”There is yet another source for the subject I have mentioned: the mysteries in the process of creation. It is what our Rabbis of blessed memory have said:17This Midrash is quoted by Rambam in his Preface to Moreh Nebuchim. See Batei Midrashoth, ed. Wertheimer, I, p. 251. “He hath declared to His people the power of His works.15Psalms 111:6. To declare the power of the process of creation to a mortal being is impossible. Therefore, Scripture closed the matter: In the beginning G-d created.” Thus is elucidated what we have said on this subject.18That the details in the process of creation and the settlement of the earth were written for the purpose of justifying Israel’s possession of the land while the essential process of creation itself remains a mystery. \n",

This is why Moses (Deut. 32,17) refers to demons, שדים, as לא אלו-ה, seeing that they are not eternal, are subject to death as our sages taught (Chagigah 16) The reason that the term “elo-ha” here appears in the plural mode, i.e. “elo-him,” is to teach us that G’d is the origin of all the various visible and invisible manifestations in the universe. This is what the prophet (Isaiah 6,3) has in mind when he described G’d as מלא כל הארץ כבודו, “the entire globe is a manifestation of His glory.” There is no other existence unless it has emanated from His existence. This is what Nechemyah 9,6 had in mind when he said ואתה מחיה את כלם, “You provide life for all of them.” When speaking of “appearances,” every phenomenon which is abstract as distinct from being tangible, is described by the generic term אלוקים. Professional, i.e. expert judges are called אלוהים, as they are able to pronounce judgment בצלם אלוקים, reflecting Divine wisdom.

      "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth: The reason that the Torah started with the letter 'bet' is that King Shlomo, in all of the book of Kohelet, compares the Torah to the Sun, which only moves in three directions like the shape of the 'bet,' that is only open on its north side [according to ancient maps that would place north on the left of the page and east on top]; and because it was given through Moshe, whose face is like the sun; and maybe the reason is that the evil inclination that opposes the Torah comes from the North and it 'breaks the fence' of the Torah, as it is stated (Joel 2:20), \"And the northern one will I distance from you.\" And also because gold, which comes form the North, opposes the Torah; and they generally flee from one another, as it is stated (Psalms 119:71), \"It is good that I have become poor, so that I can learn your statute;\" And this is not the place to speak more about this. And it is possible to also explain it, in the way that it is stated (Proverbs 9:1), \"Wise women have built their house;\" hence, the wisdom of the Torah began with 'bet' [which sounds like bayit, the Hebrew word for house], since it is the mistress of the larger 'house.' \n",

But there is a difficulty about this, since it should have been written, \"Created God the beginning,\" since it is logical that  anything that the name of God could precede, it should precede; since behold [the knowledge of] the existence of God is not dependent upon the knowledge of the earlier things in the creation, about which the word bereshit [in the beginning] relates to, according to most commentators. \n",

      "And also [difficult] is that the writer of the Akeida [commentary - R.

And what appears most likely to me, is to say that Rashi wanted to fix all of this when he said that \"this text says nothing if not 'interpret me' - [the term reshit, literally, the start or head of is used here] because of the Torah and Israel which are [both] called reshit;\" which means to say that it is impossible to know about God's existence, may He be blessed, except through the Torah and Israel. That's why they are called reshit, since they are both an introduction through which one comes to the knowledge of God's existence, may He be blessed [and so precede the name of God in the first sentence of the Torah.] Since the Torah publicizes faith in His creation and Divinity, may He be blessed. And Israel also knew to publicize the existence of God, may He be blessed, from the angle of the transmission that they received, one person from another, back to Adam who saw the world destroyed and built, and is a faithful witness to the creation of the world, which is a sign [indication] of its Creator; and this transmission was spread by the offspring of Avraham, Yitschak and Yisrael. \n",

      "IN THE BEGINNING G-D CREATED. Rashi wrote: “This verse calls aloud for elucidation,19The difficulties in the verse are: (a) The word bereshith (in the beginning) appears throughout the Bible in a construct form such as: In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim (Jeremiah 27:1). But here it cannot be in construct form since such a form can be used only in connection with a noun, and the word bara (He created) is a verb. (b) Again, it cannot be said that here bereshith is actually in a construct form and that a missing noun is implied, thus making the sense of the verse, “in the beginning of all, G—d created…,” for if so, the following difficulty presents itself: since Scripture, according to this interpretation, sets out to tell us the order in which things were created, why does it say in Verse 2 And the spirit of G-d hovered over the face of the waters when it has not yet told us when water was created? Hence Rashi turns to a Midrashic interpretation in which the word reshith is another name for the Torah and Israel. The word bereshith is thus not in a construct form but stands by itself, and the sense conveyed is: “For the sake of that which is reshith [Torah and Israel] G-d created.” as our Rabbis have explained it:20Bereshith Rabbah 1:6; Tanchuma (Buber) Bereshith 3. “For the sake of Torah which is called reshith, as it is said, The Eternal made me as ‘reshith’ (the beginning) of His way,21Proverbs 8:22. and for the sake of Israel who is called reshith, as it is said, Israel is the Eternal’s hallowed portion, the ‘reshith’ (first-fruits) of His increase.”22Jeremiah 2:3.This Midrash of our Rabbis is very hidden and secret for there are many things the Rabbis found that are called reshith and concerning which they give Midrashic interpretations, and those wanting in faith count their multitude. For example, they [the Rabbis] have said:23Bereshith Rabbah 1:6. “For the merit acquired by [fulfilling the commandments associated with] three things has the world been created: for the merit of the Dough-offering, for the merit of Tithes and for the merit of the First-fruits. In the beginning G-d created. Reshith surely signifies the Dough-offering, as it is said, The first of your dough.24Numbers 15:20. Reshith surely signifies the Tithes, as it is said, The first of thy corn.25Deuteronomy 18:4. Reshith surely signifies the First-fruits, as it is said, The first-fruits of thy land.”26Exodus 23:19.The Rabbis have further said:23Bereshith Rabbah 1:6. “For the merit acquired by Moses [the world has been created], as it is said, And he chose a first part for himself.”27Deuteronomy 33:21. Reference here is to Moses who took the territory of Kings Sihon and Og as he knew that his grave was to be therein. (See Rashi, ibid.) It was thus for the sake of this meritorious person, of whom reshith was said, that the world was created.Their intent in the above texts is as follows: the word bereshith alludes to the creation of the world by Ten Emanations, and hints in particular to the emanation called Wisdom, in which is the foundation of everything, even as it says, The Eternal hath founded the earth by wisdom.28Proverbs 3:19. This is the Heave-offering [referred to in the Midrash mentioned above], and it is holy; it has no precise measure,29By law of the Torah, the Heave-offering given to the priest has no fixed measure; the owner may give according to his discretion. “Even one grain frees the whole mound” (Kiddushin 58 b). Similarly, our conception of Divine wisdom is infinitesimal in relation to its true scope. thus indicating the little understanding created beings have of it. Now just as a man counts ten measures — this alludes to the Ten Emanations — and sets aside one measure of the ten as a Tithe, so do the wise men contemplate the tenth Emanation and speak about it. The Dough-offering, which is the single commandment pertaining to the dough, alludes to this. Now Israel, which is called reshith as mentioned above, is “the congregation of Israel,” which is compared in the Song of Songs to a bride and whom Scripture in turn calls “daughter,” “sister” and “mother.” The Rabbis have already expressed this in a homiletic interpretation of the verse, Upon the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him,30Song of Songs 3:11. and in other places. Similarly, the verse concerning Moses, And he chose a first part for himself,27Deuteronomy 33:21. Reference here is to Moses who took the territory of Kings Sihon and Og as he knew that his grave was to be therein. (See Rashi, ibid.) It was thus for the sake of this meritorious person, of whom reshith was said, that the world was created. which they [the Rabbis in the above Midrash] interpret to mean that Moses our teacher contemplated [the Deity] through a lucid speculum,31So clearly stated in Yebamoth 49b. and he saw that which is called reshith (the first) for himself, and therefore he merited the Torah. Thus all the above Midrashim have one meaning. Now it is impossible to discuss this explanation at length in writing, and even an allusion is dangerous since people might have thoughts concerning it which are untrue. But I have mentioned this [i.e., the above brief explanation] in order to close the mouths of those wanting in faith and of little wisdom, who scoff at the words of our Rabbis. \n",

      "IN THE BEGINNING. Rashi wrote: “If you wish to explain it [the word bereshith] in accordance with its plain meaning, explain it thus: at the beginning of the creation of the heaven and earth, and the earth was formless and void and there was darkness, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, Let there be light.” If so, the whole text leads into the creation of light.Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained it in an identical way. However, he established that the letter vav in the word veha’aretz (and the earth) does not şerve [as a connecting letter as it normally does and which would mean “and,” but it serves rather as the word “when.”] There are many such examples in Scripture. The meaning then according to Rabbi Abraham would be: at the beginning of the creation of heaven and dry land, there was no habitable place on earth; rather, it was unformed and void and covered with water, and G-d said, Let there be light. According to Abraham ibn Ezra’s opinion, only light32According to Rashi in Verse 6 (also 2:4), the sun, etc., was also created on the first day. was created on the first day.The difficulty which Rabbi Shlomo [Rashi] had which led him to the above interpretation is, as he said: For if Scripture intended to teach the order in which the acts of creation took place, it should have written barishonah [instead of bereshith], since wherever the word reshith occurs in Scripture it is in the construct state. But there is the verse, Declaring the end ‘mereshith’ [from the beginning].33Isaiah 46:10. Here the word reshith is not in the construct state. And if one will connect it with the missing word davar [thing — thus making the verse read: “Declaring the end of a thing from the beginning of a thing”—] here too it could be connected to a missing word.34Thus reading: Bereshith kol, (In the beginning of everything [G—d created]). There is also the verse, And he chose ‘reshith’ (a first part) for himself.27Deuteronomy 33:21. Reference here is to Moses who took the territory of Kings Sihon and Og as he knew that his grave was to be therein. (See Rashi, ibid.) It was thus for the sake of this meritorious person, of whom reshith was said, that the world was created. [Here again the word reshith is not used in the construct state.] And Rashi raised other objections.Now listen to the correct and clear explanation of the verse in its simplicity. The Holy One, blessed be He, created all things from absolute non-existence. Now we have no expression in the sacred language for bringing forth something from nothing other than the word bara (created). Everything that exists under the sun or above was not made from non-existence at the outset. Instead He brought forth from total and absolute nothing a very thin substance devoid of corporeality but having a power of potency, fit to assume form and to proceed from potentiality into reality. This was the primary matter created by G-d; it is called by the Greeks hyly (matter). After the hyly, He did not create anything, but He formed and made things with it, and from this hyly He brought everything into existence and clothed the forms and put them into a finished condition.Know that the heavens and all that is in them consist of one substance, and the earth and everything that is in it consist of one substance. The Holy One, blessed be He, created these two substances from nothing;35Such is also the theory of Rambam: “All things on earth have one common substance; the heavens and the things in them have one substance different from the first” (Moreh Nebuchim II, 26). they alone were created, and everything else was constructed from them.This substance, which the Greeks called hyly, is called in the sacred language tohu, the word being derived from the expression of the Sages:36Kiddushin 40b. “betohei (when the wicked bethinks himself) of his doings in the past.” If a person wants to decide a name for it [this primordial matter], he may bethink himself, change his mind and call it by another name since it has taken on no form to which the name should be attached. The form which this substance finally takes on is called in the sacred language bohu, which is a composite word made up of the two words bo hu (in it there is [substance]). This may be compared to the verse, Thou art not able ‘asohu’ (to perform it),37Exodus 18:18. in which case the word asohu is missing a vav and an aleph [and is a composite of the two words] aso hu. It is this which Scripture says, And he shall stretch over it the line of ‘tohu’ (confusion) and the stones of ‘bohu.’38Isaiah 34:11. “The stones,” which are forms in the building (as explained later on by Ramban), thus constitute substance as expressed in the Hebrew bohu. [The tohu in Hebrew or hyly in Greek] is the line by which the craftsman delineates the plan of his structure and that which he hopes to make. This is derived from the expression, Kavei (Hope) unto G-d.39Psalms 27:14. The stones are forms in the building. Similarly it is written, They are accounted by Him as nought and ‘tohu,’40Isaiah 40:17. as tohu comes after nothingness and there is nothing yet in it.So the Rabbis have also said in Sefer Yetzirah:412:6. Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation) is one of the earliest Hebrew books of the Cabala tradition. (See introduction to Bereshith, Note 56.) Some of the profoundest mystic commentaries have been written on this book. See my Hebrew work, Kithvei Haramban, Vol. 2, pp. 451-461. “He created substance from tohu, and made that which was nothing something.”They have furthermore said in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah:42Called also Sefer Habahir (Book of the Bright Light), 2. This book too is a classic in the mystic teachings of the Cabala. It was written in the style and manner of the Midrashim. “Rabbi Berachyah said: ‘What is the meaning of the verse, And the earth was ‘tohu’ (without form) ‘vavohu’ (and void)? What is the meaning of the word “was?” It had already been tohu. And what is tohu? It is a thing which astonishes people. It was then turned into bohu. And what is bohu? It is a thing which has substance, as it is written, [bohu is a composite of the two words] ‘bo hu’ (in it there is substance).’” \n",

      "AND ‘ELOKIM’ (G-D) SAID. The word Elokim means “the Master of all forces,” for the root of the word is e-il, meaning force, and the word Elokim is a composite consisting of the words e-il heim, as if the word e-il is in a construct state, and heim, [literally] “they,” alludes to all other forces. Thus Elokim means “the Force of all forces.” A secret will yet be disclosed in connection with this.43See Ramban, Exodus 20:3.If so, the simple correct explanation of the verse is as follows: In the beginning44Ramban thus indicates his opinion that the word bereshith is not in a construct state. This is contrary to Rashi, as explained above. G-d created the heavens means He brought forth their matter from nothing; and the earth means that He brought forth its matter from nothing. And the earth, includes all the four elements,45Fire, wind, water, and earth. [not merely the land] as in the verse, And the heaven and the earth were finished,46Genesis 2:1. which includes the entire lower sphere, and in Praise the Eternal from the earth, ye sea-monsters, and all deeps,47Psalms 148:7. and as in many other verses. Now with this creation, which was like a very small point having no substance, everything in the heavens and on the earth was created. The word eth —[eth hashamayim ve’eth ha’aretz] — is like “the essence of a thing.” The Sages have always set it forth as serving to include,48Pesachim 22b. since it is derived from the expression, The morning ‘atha’ (cometh), and also the night.49Isaiah 21:12. And so did our Rabbis say:50Bereshith Rabbah 1:19. “‘Eth hashamayim (the heavens)’ — eth includes the sun, moon, stars and constellations. ‘Ve’eth ha’aretz (and the earth)’ — ve’eth includes the trees, herbs, and the Garden of Eden.” These include all created things which are corporeal.Now after having said that with one command G-d created at first the heavens and the earth and all their hosts, Scripture returns and explains that the earth after this creation was tohu, that is, matter without substance. It became bohu when He clothed it with form. Then it [Scripture] explains that in this form was included the form of the four elements: fire, water, earth, and air. The word ha’aretz (the earth) includes these four elements. In this verse, the element of fire is called “darkness”51And darkness was upon the face of the deep. So also explained in the Moreh Nebuchim, II:30: “By Choshech the element fire is meant, nothing else.” Ramban’s reasoning on this point is also found there. because the elemental fire is dark. Were it red, it would redden the night for us. The element of water with which the dust was kneaded is here called “deep.”51And darkness was upon the face of the deep. So also explained in the Moreh Nebuchim, II:30: “By Choshech the element fire is meant, nothing else.” Ramban’s reasoning on this point is also found there. This is why the waters of the oceans are called “the deeps,” as it is written, The deeps cover them;52Exodus 15:15. The deeps were congealed;53Ibid., 8. The deep was round about me.54Jonah 2:6. The bottom of the ocean is also referred to as “deep:” And He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up, and He led them through the depths, as a wilderness;55Psalms 106:9. He led them through the deep as a horse in the wilderness.56Isaiah 63:13. And the element air is here called “spirit.”57And the spirit of G-d hovered over the face of the waters.Now it is already known that the four elements fill up the whole space with matter.58“This sphere in its totality is composed of the celestial orbs, the four elements and their combinations; there is no vacuum whatever therein, but the whole space is filled up with matter.” (Guide of the Perplexed, Friedlander’s translation, I, 72.) That which stands still is the sphere of earth. The waters surround the earth, the air encompasses the waters, and the fire envelopes the air.59From the language of Rambam, ibid. It is to be noted that Ramban follows Yehudah al Charizi’s translation of Rambam’s philosophic work and not that of Shmuel ibn Tibbon. See my Hebrew work, The Life of Ramban, pp. 23-24, on the far-reaching significance of this point. Scripture thus states that the earth took on form, and the fire above enveloped the intermingled waters and dust, and the wind blew and rose in the darkness and hovered over the waters.It appears to me that this [primeval] point, [which G-d created out of absolute nought], which took on form and became bohu, is what the Sages call:60Yoma 54b. This “foundation rock” is the stone on which the Ark of the Covenant rested in the Holy of Holies in King Solomon’s Temple. “‘The rock of foundation’ from which the world was founded.”The purport of the verses is thus: In the beginning G-d created the heavens from nought, and He created the earth from nought. The earth, when created, was tohu and then it became bohu, and in these there were “darkness” [i.e., fire, as explained above], water, dust and the wind blowing upon the water. Thus everything was created and made. The reason why ruach (wind) is attached to the name of G-d [as it says, and the spirit of God] is that it is the least substantial of all elements61Although fire is thinner than wind, since the element of fire is alluded to in the verse by the word “darkness,” as explained above, it would not be fitting to attach it to the name of G—d. (Bachya). and is above them, hovering upon the face of the waters only by command of the Holy One, blessed be He.In case you seek information concerning the creation of the incorporeal angels, you will not find it explained in the Torah. The Sages, however, have explained concerning them that they were created on the second day, so that you should not say that they assisted in the creation of the world.62Bereshith Rabbah 3:11. But if you will merit and understand the secret of the word bereshith and why Scripture does not begin by saying, “G-d created in the beginning,” you will know that, in the way of truth,63A reference to the true wisdom of the Cabala which enables one to grasp the mysteries of the Torah. Scripture tells about the lower creations and alludes to the higher ones and that the word bereshith refers covertly to the Emanation called Wisdom, which is the head of all beginnings, as I have mentioned. This is why they translated bereshith in the Jerusalem Targum to mean “in wisdom,” and the word is adorned in the Torah with a crown on the letter beth.64The adornment on the top of the letter beth hints at the Kether (Crown) above, from which all emanations issue. It is also referred to as Ein Sof (the Infinite). See my Hebrew commentary, p. 15. \n",

      "IN THE BEGINNING. Our wise men1The Hebrew grammarians. See Ibn Janah, Sefer ha-Rikmah, 6:2. taught that the letter bet (of bereshit, in the beginning) is superfluous.2The letter bet placed before the word reshit has no translatable meaning. According to Weiser it is there for emphasis. Our verse should thus be rendered: First God created heaven and earth. They compare it to the bet in the word ba-rishonah (at the first) (Genesis 13:4). We know the bet in ba-rishonah to be superfluous for we find they shall set forth first (rishonah) (Numbers 2:9).3According to this opinion rishonah and ba-rishonah mean the same. Hence the bet of ba-rishonah is superfluous. However, if this were so the bet (of bereshit) would be vocalized with a long kamatz.4As is the bet of ba-rishonah. The fact that the bet of bereshit is vocalized with a sheva proves that both cases are not exactly the same. Other scholars maintain that the word bereshit is always in the construct and its meaning in our verse is: “In the beginning of the evening, or of the night, or of the darkness.”5The word or phrase that bereshit is connected to is missing and must be supplied by the reader. According to Cherez, I.E. is trying to explain why the superfluous bet of bereshit is vocalized with a sheva while that of ba-rishonah is vocalized with a kamatz. The reason is that bereshit is in the construct and therefore is vocalized with a sheva. However, they have overlooked And he chose a first part (reshit) for himself (Deuteronomy 33:21).6Where the word reshit is in the absolute. Others say that the bet of bereshit is a preposition.7The Hebrew texts printed in our editions are most probably incorrect. We have followed Vat. Ebr. 38, which has kli ta’am rather than bli ta’am. For alternate interpretations see Filwarg, Weiser and Cherez. They explain that Scripture intends to preclude the thought that heaven and earth were preexisting. Hence it states, In the beginning.8The bet is there for emphasis. The meaning of the verse is: In the beginning, i.e., before anything was created, God created heaven and earth. I believe that bereshit is in the construct, as in In the beginning of (bereshit) the reign of Jehoiakim (Jeremiah 26:1).9I.E. agrees that bereshit is in the construct. He disagrees with the earlier quoted opinion only in maintaining that it is not always in the construct. Don’t ask, how can a word in the construct be connected to a verb in the perfect.10A noun is usually in the construct when connected to another noun, hence I.E.’s comment. This presents no problem, for we find that very case in the verse When the Lord spoke at first with Hosea (Hosea 1:2),11Techillat (at first) is in the construct with dibber (spoke). and in the verse the city where David encamped (Isaiah 29:1).12Kiryat (the city) is in the construct with chanah (encamped). The meaning of bereshit will be explained in our comments on the next verse.13That is, the explanation of what bereshit in the construct is to be connected to. \n",

      "CREATED. Most Biblical commentators explain that the word bara (created) indicates creation ex nihilo. But if the Lord make (yivra) a new thing (beri’ah) (Num. 16:30) is similar. However, they have overlooked And God created (va-yivra) the great sea monsters14God obviously did not create the sea monsters ex nihilo, for the verse concludes, and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed, which shows that the sea monsters were created out of the water. Also, it is absurd to assume that on the fifth day of creation God would create sea monsters ex nihilo. (Gen. 1:21) and the three times the word created is used in one verse, viz., And God created (va-yivra) man in His own image, in the image of God created (bara) He him; male and female created (bara) He them (Gen. 1:27). They also failed to consider I form the light, and create darkness (Is. 45:7) wherein darkness, which is the opposite of light, an existing entity, is described by the prophet as being created.15Darkness is the absence of light. Thus Isaiah uses the term created in the opposite sense of creation ex nihilo. In Isaiah it means the creation of nothing out of something (Krinsky). Hence bara does not necessarily imply creation ex nihilo. The following is the precise explanation of the word bara. Bara has two meanings, one of which has been noted above.16That is, to create or make. The second17That is, to eat. is found in the verse neither did he eat (bara) bread with them (II Samuel 12:17). However, in the latter case, an alef has been substituted for a heh.18Most of our manuscripts of the Bible have barah with a heh. However, Ibn Ezra’s manuscript must have had bara with an alef. See also Jacob ben Haim’s edition of the Hebrew Bible, 1524, which has the same reading as Ibn Ezra. There is some difficulty in understanding this comment as the printed text is corrupt. We have followed Vat. Ebr. 38 as suggested by Weiser. For a different rendering see Filwarg. The reason is that bara (in I Sam. 12:17) is similar to le-havrot (to urge to eat) in And all the people came to cause David to eat (le-havrot) bread (II Sam. 3:35). The verb le-havrot appears in the hifil (and its root ends with heh), for if it ended with an alef, Scripture would have read le-havri, as in to make yourselves fat (le-havri’achem) with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel (I Sam. 2:29). We also find bara conjugated in the pi’el, as in and cut down (u-vereta) for thyself (trees) (Joshua 17:15). This is not like the similar word beru in choose (beru) you a man for you (I Sam. 17:8) but rather like bare (hack, dispatch) in and dispatch them (u-vare) with their swords19Ibn Janah, The Book of Roots, root bet, resh, alef, explains bara in Josh. 17:15 to mean chose, as in I Sam. 17:8. Ibn Ezra disagrees. The point of I.E’s comment is that bara spelled bet, resh, alef primarily means to cut. It is encountered with this meaning in both the kal and pi’el. Bara also means to eat. However, in the latter case its root is bet, resh, heh, although it is found spelled bet, resh, alef in I Sam. 17:8. In the latter instance, however, we treat it as if there were an interchange between the heh and alef. (Ezekiel 23:47). The meaning of bara is to cut or to set a boundary. The intelligent person will understand what I am alluding to.20I. Husik, A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy, p. 190, notes, “The Hebrew word bara, ordinarily translated “created,” which implies to most people the idea of creatio ex nihilo, Ibn Ezra renders, in accordance with its etymology, to limit, to define, by drawing or incising a line or boundary. Having said this, Ibn Ezra, in his wonted mysterious manner, stops short, refusing to say more, and preferring to mystify the reader by adding the tantalizing phrase, ‘The intelligent will understand.’ He means apparently to indicate that an eternal matter was endowed with form.” Nahman Krochmal, More Nevuche Ha-zeman (quoted by Krinsky), suggests that Ibn Ezra’s belief is similar to that of the Kabbalists; i.e., the world was created out of an emanation from God. See also C. Sirot, Philosophy in the Middle Ages (Hebrew), p. 112. Ibn Ezra was a neo-Platonist. According to neo-Platonism the world came about by emanation from God. Ibn Ezra is apparently saying that at the creation spoken of in the first chapter of Genesis, God gave final form to what had previously emanated from Him. \n",

      "GOD. Elohim (God) is a plural. We know this because we come across the singular form Elo’ah.21Ps. 114:7. Elo’ah being the singular of Elohim. Elohim is employed stylistically. Every language has honorific terminology. In the non-Hebrew tongues when an inferior addresses a superior he employs the plural. In Arabic it is customary for a dignitary such as a king to speak in the plural. In Hebrew, too, it is considered a sign of dignity to employ the plural when speaking of a superior. Such is the case with the words adonim (lords) and be’alim (owners). Thus Scripture says, a cruel lord (adonim) (Is. 19:4),22Adonim is a plural, yet its meaning in this verse is singular (lord). The singular of adonim is adon. and and the owner thereof (be’alav) shall accept it (Exodus 22:10).23Be’alav literally means, its owners. The terms alav (upon him), elav (to him), and adav (unto him) are similar.24All of these words have plural endings, yet are used to indicate singulars. It is for this reason that Scipture reads bara Elohim and not bare’u Elohim.25Since Elohim is to be understood as singular, the verb following it (bara) is in the singular. If Elohim were plural, the verb following it would also be plural (bare’u). We know from the study of logic that speech is called safah26Safah is the Hebrew word for lip. The point is that more than the lips are involved in speech, but speech is so called because it is seen to come from the lips. because it is seen to come from the lips. Similarly man’s highest soul is called heart (lev) even though the soul itself is incorporeal while the heart is corporeal. It is referred to in this manner because the heart is its first resting place. Similarly God is called Elohim because His actions are executed via angels who do His will and who are referred to as Elohim.27Man’s soul is often referred to in Scripture as lev because the soul acts via the heart. Similarly God is called Elohim because He acts via the angels. Husik, p. 191, points out that according to I.E., “God cannot come in contact with the material and changeable (hence)…it follows that (the terrestrial world)…was not made directly by him, but by angels; hence the word Elohim is used in the first chapter of Genesis, which means primarily the angels, and secondarily God as acting through the angels.” I will explain part of the secret of God’s name when I comment on for My name is in him (Ex. 23:21). Pay no heed to the opinion of Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who holds that man is superior to the angels. I have already explained to you in The Book of Foundation that all of his proofs are wrong. We know that the prophets are the most exalted human beings. Nevertheless, the prophet Joshua fell upon his face and prostrated himself before God’s angel and said to him, What saith my lord unto his servant (Josh. 5:14).28Joshua’s bowing before God’s angels proves that angels are superior to prophets. The same is true of the prophets Zechariah and Daniel.29Both address the angels as superiors. See Zechariah 1:9 and Dan. 10:17. Why should I elaborate when this point is so elementary?The meaning of Lord of Hosts (Elohe ha-tzeva’ot) is the same as God of gods (Elohe ha-Elohim) (Deut. 10:17).30We thus see that Elohim means the same as tzeva’ot (hosts or angels). The definition of elohim (lord) is angels.31Reading malakh (angel) rather than melekh (king) (Weiser). People engaged in the dispensation of God’s justice are also called elohim.32According to Rabbinic interpretation Elohim at times signifies a judge. See Mekhilta on Ex. 21:6. Elohim is an adjective, not a proper noun.33Hence it can be declined and be in the construct. A proper noun cannot. I.E. seems to limit the term noun to proper nouns. Apparently common nouns were treated like adjectives. It is not found conjugated in the perfect or imperfect.34Hebrew adjectives have verbal forms. However, Elohim is never found in the verbal form. Nevertheless, Ibn Ezra insists that it is an adjective. One should not assume that angels are composed of fire and air because Scripture states, Who makest winds Thy messengers, The flaming fire Thy ministers (Psalms 104:4).35Which implies that God makes his angels out of wind. This is not the literal meaning of this verse. David (in Psalm 104) speaks first of creation. He starts with light and says, Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment (Ps. 104:2). He then goes on to say, Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain, heaven referring to the firmament upon which is water, fire, snow and wind. David next says that the wind serves as God’s agent; i.e., it goes wherever God sends it. He speaks in a similar vein of fire as one of God’s ministers.36Psalm 104. It is not to be taken as implying that the angels are made out of fire. It rather means that fire is God’s agent. Cf. Ibn Ezra on Ps. 104:4. David then says, Who didst establish the earth upon its foundations (Ps. 104:5), which refers to dry land. Similarly it is written, Stormy wind, fulfilling His word (Ps. 148:8).37Which shows that the wind is God’s agent. Krinsky suggests that this quote is misplaced and should follow, “it (the winds) goes wherever God sends it.” \n",

The word et is a most difficult word to translate because it has many different meanings, depending on the context. However, sometimes it is omitted, as in that God created man (Deut. 4:32). It is also found placed before the subject, as in and when there came a lion, or (ve-et) a bear (I Sam. 17:34). However, the latter usage is very rare.

      "THE HEAVEN. The definite article (ha) is placed before heaven (shamayim) to indicate that Scripture speaks of the heaven visible to man.40That is, the firmament. According to I.E. there is a heaven above the firmament which is invisible to man. This heaven is eternal. It contains the spheres in which the planets and constellations are embodied. Above this heaven is the abode of the angels. Cf. Husik, p. 190. Heaven (shamayim) is always written in the plural.41The word shamayim (heaven) is a plural. It is possible that its dominion in Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? Canst thou establish its dominion over the earth?42In this verse its dominion is in the singular. Since shamayim is a plural, we would expect “their dominion” rather than “its dominion.” (Job 38:33) refers to the dominion exercised by each one of the heavenly spheres.43See note 40 above. See also Ibn Ezra’s Introduction, page XVII, second paragraph. The meaning of shamayim (heaven) is high and above, as it is in Arabic, a language akin in form to Hebrew. There is also a heaven of heavens.44Cf. Ps. 148:4. Scripture in our chapter speaks of the visible heaven. However, in Psalm 148 it speaks of the “heaven of heavens.” The heaven of heavens is the spheres (Krinsky). See note 40. The word for heaven (shamayim) is never written in the singular.45Even if the reference is to one of the heavens. It is like the words millstone (rechayim) and noon (tzohorayim). Those who are well-versed in geometry will understand these secrets.46They will understand the reference to the heaven of heavens. Saadiah Gaon says that the earth may be compared to a point and the heaven to a thread circling it. Since Scripture tells us that heaven and earth were created, we deduce from this that all their contents, such as fire and water, were also created.47Scripture does not explicitly mention the creation of fire and water, two of the four elements. However, according to Saadiah the creation of these two elements is implied. There was no need for Scripture to mention their creation as their creation is self evident. For how could the fire and water, which filled the void between heaven and earth, be in existence before the creation of their container? Cf. I.E.’s alternate commentary on this verse in Weiser, p. 145. Others say that the earth includes water and the heaven air.48Hence Scripture does state that these two elements were created. However, in my opinion the heaven and earth spoken of in our verse refer only to the firmament and the dry land.49Gen. 1:1 does not tell us that God created heaven and earth on the first day; neither does it deal with the creation of matter. I.E. will explain the meaning of this verse later on in his comments. For only one thing was created on each day. Thus light was created on the first day, the firmament on the second, plants on the third, luminaries on the fourth, and living creatures on the fifth and the sixth. This interpretation is borne out by the psalm quoted above (Psalm 104). It is impossible to maintain that the line circling the dot was created before the dot, or the dot before the circle. Hence our sages say that heaven and earth were created simultaneously.50Hagigah 12a. They offer as proof of their viewpoint, Yea, My hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, And My right hand hath spread out the heavens; When I call unto them, They stand up together (Is. 48:13).51They stand up together implies that they were created simultaneously. However, this proof is questionable. The plain meaning of this verse is not so, for how could God address that which was not yet created?52How can the Bible say, “When I call unto them,” if they were not yet in being? How could He call to that which was in a chaotic state? The explanation of this verse is as follows: I, God, created heaven and earth. When I call them, they stand before Me as servants ready to do My will. The meaning of this verse is similar to that of Thy word standeth fast in heaven (Ps. 119:89). After stating this the Psalmist makes mention of the earth (Ps. 119:90). He then goes on to say that heaven and earth stand ready to execute any commands that God will direct to them (Ps. 119:91). \n",

And it is as the Rabbis, of blessed memory, have stated (Midrash HaGadol, Genesis 1:1), \"To tell the power of the story of creation to flesh and blood  is not possible.\" Hence it is not fitting for the follower of Torah to uproot the verses from their understanding in order to make them agree with the natural sciences. It is also not fitting for the scientist to deny that the Torah is divine (min hashamayim) if he finds things in its stories that don't agree with natural science. But it is fitting for this one and that one, that they contemplate the inner workings of human hearts and the ways of wisdom that is used by nature in speaking to the heart of every individual: to the youth according to his manner and to the young man in a different manner and to the old man in a different manner [still]; to the strong in a particular manner and to the weak in a particular manner; to the rich man in one manner and to the poor man in another manner; and so [too] with all groups of men, nature speaks to their hearts in a specific way that is fitting to the people of that group. And nature does not reveal the pristine truth - without any mask or cover - to any one of these groups. And so [too] the Giver of the Torah, may He be blessed, (since the God that created nature and the God that gave us the Torah is one God.) in his speaking with people was required to speak according to their levels, and not according to His level, may He be blessed. And behold, God wanted to inform people of the unity of the [universe] and the unity of mankind; since error in both of these matters caused great evils in ancient times: from the lack of awareness of the unity of the [universe], it came out that people would believe in the existence of specific gods, with defects and inferior character traits; and they would do evil acts in order to please [these gods] (see what I have written in Parshat Yitro on the verse, \"There shall not be for you\" [Exodus 20:3]). And from the lack of awareness of the unity of mankind, it came out that the people of one nation would hate and revile the people of another nation and they would act towards them with the force of arms, and not with justice and righteousness. And these two fundamental principles (the unity of the [universe] and the unity of mankind) are the main point of the stories of the creation saga; and details of the book also include other intentions, as will be explained.  \n",

      "In the beginning, God created: Many have already been disturbed [about] why there is no proclamation for the creation of the heavens and the earth, and why the creation of the angels is not mentioned. And one should also wonder why the first day is different from the other days of the creation; since every one of them is dedicated to a specific thing or to specific things of one type or one category. But the first day includes a specific thing which is the creation of light, and besides this [also] includes something general - and there is nothing more general than it - and that is the creation of the heavens and the earth. This is something very strange, and it would have been fitting to designate one day for the creation of the heavens and the earth, without attaching to them the creation of something specific - which is the light - on one day. And it appears to me that one answer will suffice for [all] three of the questions, and that is that the heavens and the earth were not created on the first day but before then. And this is according to what is said (Berakhot 25b), \"the Torah was not given to the ministering angels\" - and [this means] that the story of creation is only coming to tell the beginning of matters of the lower world - which is the habitation of man -  and a little of the matters of the upper world, from the angle of that which is relevant to people, which is to say from the angle of that which is useful for us [to know]. And it would not have been possible to explain to people all the matters of the heavens; but [at the same time] it was [also] not His will, may He be blessed, to bring people to believe that nothing exists except that which we see and [empirically] know. Therefore, the Torah tells what was created and made on each one of the six days of creation; and it began the story of the details of creation with one verse that includes a different creation that came before the six days - and its details were not explained in the Torah - in its stating, \"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth,\" and not stating, \"And God said, 'let there be heavens, let there be earth.'\" This is to inform that it is not His intention to tell us the details of that creation and that this is just a vague statement which contains many, many statements. And behold, the heavens and the earth mentioned here are not exactly the heavens and the earth mentioned on the second and third day. Rather the heavens mentioned here includes everything above the earth and the heavens mentioned on the second day includes only the portion from them that is known to people. And the earth that is mentioned here includes the earth that is mixed up with water, and upon which was the wind/spirit, [whereas] the earth mentioned on the third day only includes the dry land. That is, in my opinion, the main simple explanation of this verse. And lest someone say that this contradicts what comes in the Ten Commandments, \"because in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth;\" there is, in fact, no contradiction to my explanation from there, since it does not say, \"because in six days the Lord created the heavens and the earth,\" but rather, \"because in six days the Lord made;\" and the intention [there] is about the making of the firmament and about the separation of the earth from the water. And the words, \"and all that there is in it\" that are said in [the continuation of] the Ten Commandments include the light and the luminaries and the animals that are upon the earth and in the midst of the seas. And in Parshat Ki Tissa (Exodus 31:17), it shortened it and only mentioned the heavens and the earth, and included in them every thing that is in them. Also the Sages, of blessed memory, said (Pesachim 54a) that the Throne of Glory came before the creation of the world. Bara (created): The verb, bara, in the simple structure and in the passive structure, is never found in any place  with reference to human action. And we find that a man is called a doer and a former, but we don't find any place where man is called a creator (boreh). And it appears that this root is used to indicate anything that deviates from that which is the way of the world, as per, \"I will make wonders which were not created (nivrau) in all the earth\" (Exodus 34:10); \"and if the Lord creates (yivra) a creation and the ground opens its mouth\" (Numbers 16:30); \"I let you hear new things from now... they were created (nivrau) now and not from before\" (Isaiah 48:6-7); \"because the Lord created (bara) something new on the earth\" (Jeremiah 48:7); and here God created (bara) the heavens and the earth, a Godly act which has nothing like it. We find creation from nothing (ex nihilo) explicitly [mentioned] in the Book of Maccabees, Book II 7:28; and also the Samaritans say that the world was created from nothing in their liturgical poems, and it is also [included in] the faith of the Karaites. And Yechezkel, when speaking about the king of Tyre, used the expression, briah about him: \"on the day you were created (hibaraecha), they were established\" (Ezekiel 28:13); \"from the day you were created (hibaraech)\" (Ibid., 15). He poetically compared him to Adam, whom God created and placed in the Garden of Eden, which is as it is stated [there], \"you were in Eden, the garden of God;\" hence, he used the expression briah, as if [to say] that he was not formed through a father and mother; instead he was a creation that God created. And in the intensive (piel) structure, we find the root, bara, indicating chopping and cutting (Joshua 17:15; Ezekiel 23:47); and in the causative, \"lehavriachem (to feed yourselves)\" (I Samuel 2:29), [to indicate] a matter of health and portliness. And in some [versions] of II Samuel 12:17, we find bara in the simple structure [as follows]: \"and you did not create bread,\" with a [letter,] alef instead of a [letter,] hay. And that was the version [in front of] Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra, and it was not the version [in front of] Rabbi David Kimchi.   Elohim (God): El and eyal is always an expression of power and strength and elohim is the plural form; and this was [the accepted terminology] of the nations that worshiped idols (Kuzari 4:1). And they would call all of the forces of nature that are the causes of phenomena, [elohim], and they would worship them; and each one of them would be a god for them. However, the Hebrews, who were monotheists, kept this name in the plural to indicate that the God that they were worshiping was not [just] one specific power. As the non-Jews would say, \"the Lord is the god of the hills and not the god of the valleys,\" (I Kings 20:28) but [in fact] He is the collection of all the forces and the Master of every force. (And similar to this is the word, seas [yamim], see below, verse 10). So [too] is He called by the name, 'Hosts,' to say that He, Himself, contains all the powers of all of the hosts of the Heavens which the non-Jews would worship - see my commentary on Isaiah 1:9.   \n",

      "The heavens and the earth: The Torah spoke as in the language of men and divided the whole world - and all of the worlds - into two parts; that which is above and that which is below, everything according to the eyes of man that dwells upon the earth. Sama (which is similar to shamayim, the word used here to mean heavens) in Arabic, is like gava (high) in Hebrew; and ara (from which comes  araa, which is the same as arets [earth], when switching the letters, ayin and tsaddi, as in tson [in Hebrew] is aaan [in Aramaic], and ravats [accordingly turns into] rava - and from which comes arbaah [in the Targum to Isaiah 7:25] - and also ir, which is a designation for an angel, is like tsir in the Holy Language - the understanding of which is, messenger) is lowly in the Aramaic language, as in (Daniel 2:39) \"And after you, a king more lowly (ara) than you will arise.\" And according to the opinion of some (Galius and Clericus), sama and ara are derived from [the Hebrew], shamayim and arets. And plausible are the words of Rabbi Yaakov Abendana: that shamayim is from sham (there), which indicates a far place - and it is called shamayim from its being far and high from any direction that one turns. And nonetheless, [it was] from shamayim that the Arabic verb (sama) that refers to height, was afterwards derived. Since, truly, it is not possible that verbs that do not indicate an action, but [rather] the characteristic of something, like the verb sama - the understanding of which is 'being high' (altus fuit in Italian) - exist before the existence of the noun or adjective that refers to that characteristic. For example, first the blood of animals was called dam, and afterwards, [people] called that which appears like the color of blood adom (red), and afterwards [still], they made the verb and said odem (redden), odmu (they redden), and similar to it. But [concerning] ara - which is an adjective [to describe] all low things - it is plausible that they said it, before they called the earth, araa. \n",

      "In the beginning, God created: The verse is telling that when it went up into His will, may He be blessed, to create the world, He created the material of all of the creation in one instant; as the heavens that are mentioned here includes all of the existence of the upper world, and the earth includes all of the existence of the lower world. Except, given that all of the things were mixed up together and without order, the Creator decreed to refine all of the offspring of the heaven and the offspring of the earth in six days; in order that everything should be in its place that is fitting for it, and that it should act according to its law. For example, He commanded that the waters should gather and the dry land should be revealed; He commanded the earth that is should bring forth grasses and that it should bring forth living souls; he commanded the waters that they should swarm living souls; and so [too] with everything. Behold that all of these commandments were refinements, not new creations - since they were made and completed from material [already] created on the first day; however that material was created ex nihilo. And hence, the verse here did not say, \"God said, 'let there be heavens, 'let there be earth;'\" to teach us that the first creation was from absolute nothingness - since it is not possible to have the expression of speaking [to something] before the creation of [that] something. As behold, there was not yet material or anything that God, may be blessed, could command to bring out the heavens and the earth. But with the other creations that [emerged] from something else - even though they were miraculous and similar to ex nihilo, nonetheless, there was already material that they could emerge from - about them, it is fitting to say \"And God said;\" which is to say that He commanded to that in existence to bring forth something else. Still, in spite of this, even the heavens and the earth were created with His proclamation and through His will, may He be blessed, as it states (Psalms 33:6), \"With the word of God were the Heavens made,\" and so [too] our Sages, of blessed memory, stated, \"'In the beginning' is also a proclamation.\"  \n",

      "However, not many will have the wisdom needed for this approach of investigation, to come to the secret of God, as a result of man's passage through this dimmed valley of the material world; hence it is enough for man to grasp His existence, may He be blessed, from the angle of the transmission as mentioned and from the angle of the Torah as mentioned. And about this the Sages, of blessed memory, have said (Chullin 91b) that the lower ones mention His name, may He be blessed, after two words, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 6:4), \"Hear Yisrael, the Lord,\" but the upper ones don't mention the Name until after three words, as it is stated (Isaiah 6:3), \"Holy, holy, holy [is] the Lord.\" Because the intellectual power of the upper ones is pure and clean and it is easy for them to handle the essence of the investigation of these three worlds; therefore they are not allowed to mention the Name except after three holinesses, which means that they first cognate the essence of all those that exist below and understand the place of each and, through this, sanctify Him, may He be blessed, below. And from there they go up to understand the essence of all those that exist in the middle world and they sanctify Him, may He be blessed, to reign also upon them. And from there they go up to also understand their own essence, and from there they go up to grasp His name, may He be blessed; hence they do not mention the Name until they sanctify Him first in all three worlds. But the lower ones' intellects are not so pure, and not every person is able to handle this investigation since it is great; hence it is enough for them to come to recognize the existence of God, may He be blessed after the two words, \"Hear Israel;\" since \"Hear\" is to listen to the words of this Torah which publicize His divinity, may He be blessed; \"Israel\" is the transmission that spread in Israel from Adam to Abraham, who announced and publicized His divinity, may He be blessed, as Rashi explained on the verse (Genesis 24:7), \"Lord God of the heavens that took me from the house of my father;\" and from [Avraham], His divinity, may He be blessed, was publicized in all of the offspring of Israel and Yehuda, as it is stated (Psalms 76:2), \"God is known in Yehuda, in Israel His name is great.\" Thus it is stated, \"In the beginning, created\" and afterwards, \"God,\" to hint to the three [ways of knowing God's existence]: since reshit [beginning of] indicates Israel and the Torah, that are [both] called reshit; and through the creation [hence the word \"created\"], God was made known [directly through the mode of investigation]. And this is the way of modesty, by which He - in a hint - had the name of Israel precede His name, may He be blessed, [since \"reshit\" precedes \"created\"] and that is truthfully glorious splendor and greatness [that He gave] to Israel; hence it is stated \"And Your humility enlarges me.\" And some say that this humility is what He was involved with at first, for the needs of His world, and [only] afterwards did He publicize His name, may He be blessed. \n",

      "Rabbi Yitschak said, \"It was not necessary to begin the Torah, etc. but rather so that the nations should not say, 'you are thieves, etc.'\" (Rashi on Genesis 1:1): And it is difficult; and what about it, if they will say, \"you are thieves,\" and because of this, the  order of the Torah should be changed? The answer to this is that  this matter brings heresy to the world, since they will say, \"there is no law and no Judge\" [in the world] and 'whoever is strongest prevails;' since if the world had a Ruler, who sets up its matters - it comings and goings - why did He not protest against you when you took by force - by way of theft - the lands of the seven [Canaanite] nations? Since it is for this reason that the judgment of the generation of the flood was not sealed except on account of theft, as it is stated (Proverbs 28:24), \"One who steals from his father and mother and says 'it is not a transgression' is the companion of a destructive person;\" since the reason this sin is greater than others is not because of the sin itself, but rather because of the evil that comes out of it; as the sinner who steals does not place guilt upon himself and says, \"there is no transgression, since there is no God that judges in the world;\" and therefore he is the companion of a destructive person, which means to say, [he is a companion] of the generation of the flood, as it is stated about them (Genesis 6:12), \"since all flesh destroyed its way,\" since they also denied a principle of faith and said (Job 21:15), \"What is the Omnipotent, that we should serve Him, etc.\" And this is what [brought] them to practice extortion and theft in the world. And because the prevention of theft is fundamental to all of faith, therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, made it come early and warned about it in the first commandment of (Exodus 12:2), \"This month will be for you;\" as over there, it is stated (Exodus 12:21), \"And bring close and acquire for yourselves sheep,\" [meaning] from yours, and [not from] stolen ones; so explained the Ba'al HaTurim. And so too, Yitschak, when he commanded two kid goats to be brought to him, to make from them a Pesach sacrifice, he said (Genesis 27:3), \"And hunt for me venison;\" Rashi explained, from what is unowned and not from what is stolen, but since Esav's heart was not like that, it appeared to him that he could  rather \"hunt venison to bring,\" even form what is stolen; hence the Holy One, blessed be He, caused that he should not bring it, but rather that Ya'akov [should do so], as he was careful about theft. So too, the ox that Adam sacrificed, the Sages, of blessed memory, say that it had one horn on its forehead; to show that Adam [too] was one 'horn' in the world - meaning to say that he was by himself in the world - and did not steal from any creature; therefore, his sacrifice was accepted. And all this is in order to push away theft and robbery which brings heresy and apostasy. \n",

      "And that which Rav Yitschak said, \"It was not necessary to begin, etc,\" the explanation [of this] is not that the whole story from \"In the beginning\" to \"This month shall be for you\" should not have been written in the Torah at all; as behold there is a great need for the story of the creation of the world, since it publicizes the existence of God, may He be blessed; and the story of the generation of the flood publicizes His providence, may He be blessed, for reward and punishment. Besides that, there are  several commandments written in [this early section of the Torah: the prohibition of eating] the limb of a living animal to Noach, and circumcision to Avraham, and [the prohibition of eating] the sciatic nerve through Ya'akov. Rather, he means to say that since the essence of the Torah is that it was given for its commandments, if so, the Torah should have started with the first commandment [to the Jewish people]; and [as for] this story from \"In the beginning\" to \"This month shall be for you,\" it would be enough for it to placed at the end of the Torah. About this, he comes to answer and say, if it was written like that, it would have been 'a law refutable from its beginning,' and it would have strengthened the hand of the transgressors to rebel against the Torah. And when they would read \"This month shall be for you,\" all the more so would they rebel [even] more, and they will say, \"Moshe certainly invented this commandment, since how can God command about theft, in saying \"And bring close and acquire for yourselves sheep,\" [meaning] specifically from yours; since, behold, you are thieves, since you took the lands of the seven nations and God did not protest against you. Since maybe [such a reader] would not read the Torah, from beginning to end [and read about the creation, so as to understand that the Jews did not steal the land that they settled]. Therefore, it was necessary to have the story of the creation of the world precede [the first commandment of establishing the new month], to show that it is not through theft that they took [the land], but rather through justice and right. This is what the verse states (Psalms 111:6-7), \"The power of His deeds did He tell His people, to give them the inheritance of nations. The work of His hands are true and right, faithful are all of His precepts;\" since the crux of this telling that \"He told the power of His deeds to His people,\" the whole thing was in order to show that the work of His hands are true and right; that the Torah, and the tablets that are the work of God, and the righteous ones that were created with [God's] two hands; that all [of this] was in truth and right, which prevents theft. \"And faithful are all of His precepts;\" [meaning] the precepts that God decreed upon the lands of the seven nations; since it was His will, may He be blessed, to give it to [the seven Canaanite nations] and it was  His will, may He be blessed, to take it from them and God, the King, decreed to appoint new appointees upon it.\"  \n",

As they, of blessed memory, said (Mekhilta, Yitro) to explain the verse (Exodus 20:1), \"And God spoke all of these words etc.,\" and this is what they said, \"words that the mouth cannot speak;\" and it [is a reference to] Him saying all of the ten commandments in one word, and [that] one word did not precede the other. ... \n",

And this is what it states, \"Bereishit bara Elohim et hashamayim ve'et haarets\" (\"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth\"), and is exact to use the word et twice; to include all that is found in the world. And since the creations are numerous, as beyond the ten things that are recognizable and visible to everyone's eye - as were counted by the Sages, of blessed memory (Chagigah 12a), and this is what they said, \"and ten things were created on the first day: heavens and earth, light, darkness, chaos and void, etc. water, wind\" - besides these things, there are other creations that are hidden and absorbed by the powers of the foundational elements; some of them are recognized by way of dissection, some of the them by way of composition, some of them through the changing of time, some of them through the power of hyle, and [they] are too many to count. For this reason, the Creator grouped them into two large and enormous parts: in the havens and in the earth. And these are the two inclusions that were included in His saying \"et hashamayim ve'et haarets,\" and in one proclamation did He, may He be exalted, create everything. And you will find that they, of blessed memory, said (Rosh Hashanah 32a), \"[The word] 'In the beginning' [counts as a] proclamation [of creation], since with it were completed the ten proclamations with which the world was created (as there are only nine obvious proclamations of creation and this would be the tenth one).\" Everything was created in the first of all [the proclamations] but it was not yet arranged, and all of the creations were there but they lacked order; and the Holy One, blessed be He, ordered them, each thing in its day: on the first day, He set up and separated the light from the darkness and the darkness acquired its place and the light acquired its place; and on the second day, etc.  \n",

To what is this thing similar? To someone who wants to build a palace and first prepares stones and wood and dirt and all of the building materials and afterwards builds the home; so [too] the Creator, may He be blessed, created all of the needs of the world with one proclamation, and He prepared it, and everything was laying piled up in a mixture; and afterwards, He started to organize each thing in its place and did His, may He be exalted, work.  \n",

For this [reason], the Holy One, blessed be He, left it in its place - where it was created by the first proclamation - absorbed  in the flints; until man needed it and took out from them an amount [of fire] sufficient for him, as they, of blessed memory, said (Bereishit Rabbah 11), \"therefore we make the blessing of 'who has created the lights of the fire' at the end of Shabbat.\" And by this, God also revealed the nature of the [primordial] mixture - that the sources and elements were mixed up at the time of their creation, before God set each one up, according to its station.

For example, if the earth [did not emerge], there would be no place for the creations; and likewise with the other creations that were mixed up, like the light and the darkness.

And didn't you know that God has no desire for 'the speaker of lies and it cannot be established in front of His eyes.' And how could the 'beginning of His words,' God forbid, begin with words that are not correct?

And from this, [we see] that when God said the word shamayim, He did not say the shin before the mem and not the first mem before the second mem; and also the letters of every single word, He did not have the beginning of the word precede its end; and also with each and every letter, He did not have its beginning [sound] precede its end.  \n",

And as to the [Sages'] words (Bereishit Rabbah 1:3), of blessed memory, we need to elucidate how is it possible to say that the angels were created later; is it not that according to what the verse stated, \"and by the breath of His mouth, all the hosts,\" that hosts of the sky were created from the breath that came from the mouth of the Highest, (as if it were possible [to say this]); if so, perforce, according to our [very] senses, the angels were created before the heavens and the earth; since the breath came out before the word [of God], and since the heavens and the earth were created from the word, behold the breath - from which the angels were created - already preceded it. And for this reason, the verse states, \"In the beginning, created etc.;\" the explanation [of which] is that God had the later - which is the speech - precede the breath; [which is] the opposite of what is known to us about the nature of speech. And he created the heavens first and reversed the order and made speech first to breath; for the reason stated in their words, of blessed memory (Ibid.), and that is that [people] should not say that the angels helped and stretched out the heavens with Him, etc. And the verse informs us that the Master, blessed be He, does not take His lessons from the creations, as the creations are not able to reverse the order implanted within them from the time of the creation; which is not the case with the Creator, blessed be He, [who] can speak in the manner that He wants. And for this reason, you will find that the verse was precise in stating, \"By the word of God, were the heavens made,\" which has the creation of the heavens - which were created from the word - precede, and afterwards, it stated \"and by the breath of His mouth, all its hosts.\"  \n",

Also the verse that states, \"to His loved ones and to those who keep His commandments, for a thousand generations;\" refers only to \"those that keep His commandments\" - which is adjacent to it - [when] it states, \"for a thousand generations,\" and not to the word, \"His loved ones,\" which precedes [\"those who keep His commandments\"]; since behold, their reward is with them in another verse, which is the one [that states] \"for thousands.\" ... \n",

      "A SABBATH UNTO THE ETERNAL, “[This means] in honor of the Eternal [and that it is not primarily intended for man’s benefit],33In other words, we are to observe the Sabbatical year primarily as a mark of honor to G-d, and not for our benefit, in that by lying fallow for a year the land will improve. The same applies to the weekly Sabbath, which we celebrate in honor of the Creator of the world, and not primarily because we benefit physically from a day of rest. (Mizrachi). in the same sense as this expression is used in the case of the Sabbath of Creation” [i.e., the weekly Sabbath, of which it is also said, a Sabbath unto the Eternal].34Exodus 20:10. See note above. This is the language of Rashi. But this was not the intention of the Rabbis in their interpretation,35In other words, it is true that in the Torath Kohanim (Behar 1:2) there is such an interpretation of the Rabbis, likening the expression a Sabbath unto the Eternal stated here in the case of the Sabbatical year to that mentioned in the law of the weekly Sabbath. But the intent thereof is not as Rashi presented it, for etc. The full text of the Beraitha of the Torath Kohanim will be mentioned further on by Ramban. for all [weekly] Sabbaths, and also the festivals, are in honor of the Eternal, and yet in not one of them [i.e., the festivals] does Scripture say that they are “unto the Eternal.” Instead, it says it shall be a solemn rest unto you,36Above, 23:24. and in the case of the Day of Atonement it states, It shall be unto you a Sabbath of solemn rest.37Ibid., Verse 32. The text of the Beraitha in the Torah Kohanim [quoted by Rashi] is as follows:38Torath Kohanim, Behar 1:2. “A Sabbath unto the Eternal. Just as it says with reference to the Sabbath of Creation, so is it said regarding the Sabbatical year, a Sabbath unto the Eternal.” But the meaning of a Sabbath unto the Eternal thy G-d34Exodus 20:10. See note above. stated in connection with the Sabbath of Creation, is that on it He ceased from work and rested39Exodus 31:17. and therefore thou shalt not do any manner of work.34Exodus 20:10. See note above. It was with reference to that idea that the Sages, of blessed memory, said that the same expression is also stated in the case of the Sabbatical year, since it is the seventh in [the cycle of] the years [just as the weekly Sabbath is the seventh day in the cycle of days; and the meaning thereof here is that since the seventh year is a Sabbath to the Eternal, as will be explained, we are to desist from working the land].Now here [in the Torath Kohanim mentioned above, the Rabbis] have roused our attention to one of the great secrets of the Torah.40See in Exodus (Vol. II, p. 341, Note 23). Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has already given us a hint of it when he wrote: “The meaning of a Sabbath unto the Eternal is like that of the Sabbath-day.41For just as the Sabbath was given for the purpose of contemplating G-d’s deeds and meditating upon His Torah, so also is the purport of the Sabbatical year, since it is the seventh of the years (Mekor Chayim in his commentary to Ibn Ezra). The secret of the years of the world is alluded to in this place.” [Thus far is Ibn Ezra’s comment.]Bend now your ear to understand that which I am permitted to inform you about it in the words that I will cause you to hear, and if you will be worthy, you will contemplate them [and understand them]. I have already written in Seder Bereshith42Genesis 2:3 (Vol. I, pp. 61-64). that the six days of creation represent [all] the days of the world, and the seventh day is a Sabbath unto the Eternal thy G-d,34Exodus 20:10. See note above. for on it will be the Sabbath to the Great Name, just as we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:43Tamid 7:4. “On the seventh day what psalm did the Levites sing [in the Sanctuary? They sang] A Psalm, a Song. For the Sabbath-day44Psalms 92:1. — [a song] for the World to Come, which will be wholly a Sabbath, and rest for life everlasting.” Thus the [seven] days [of the week] allude to that which He created in the process of creation, and the [seven] years [of the Sabbatical cycle] refer to that which will occur during the creation of all “the days” of the world. It is for this reason that Scripture was more stringent regarding [the transgression of the laws of] the Sabbatical year than with respect to those guilty of transgressing all other negative commandments, and made it punishable with exile, just as He was stringent with respect to forbidden sexual relations [for which the punishment of the people, as opposed to that of the individual, is also exile];45Above, 18:28. as it is said, Then shall the Land be paid her Sabbaths,46Further, 26:34. and He repeated this matter many times: As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest,47Ibid., Verse 35. and it is further said, And the Land shall lie forsaken without them, and shall be paid her Sabbaths.48Ibid., Verse 43. “And so we have been taught [in a Mishnah]:49Aboth 5:9. Our text of the Mishnah has a variant reading. See my Hebrew commentary p. 167, Note 55. “Exile comes for the delaying of justice, and for the perversion of justice, and for [the neglect of] the year of rest for the Land.” [This stringency of punishment is] because whoever denies it [i.e., the law of the Sabbatical year], does not acknowledge the work of creation and [life in] the World to Come. Similarly the prophet [Jeremiah] was stringent, and decreed exile for neglecting to send [Hebrew] servants to freedom in the seventh year [of their service], as it is said, I made a covenant with your fathers … At the beginning of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother etc.,50Jeremiah 34:13-14. — The verse there reads ‘mikeitz sheva shanim’, which is normally translated as “at the end of seven years” (so also in the J.P.S. translation). Ramban in Deuteronomy 15:1, however, brings proofs that the correct meaning in this context is “at the end-year of the seven years”, i.e., at the beginning of seventh year, rather than “at the end of the seventh year.” Thus the Hebrew servant goes free at the beginning of the seventh year [the end-year of the cycle of seven years], and this is indeed the accepted law (Rambam, Hilchoth Avadim 2:1) that he serves for six years. See, however, Yonathan ben Uziel in Jeremiah. for in the case of a servant the seventh year is also like a [complete] Jubilee; and the Jubilee is known also [at the very beginning of the Torah] — from ‘Bereshith’ (In the beginning) to ‘Vayechulu’ (And there were finished)51In other words, in the Scriptural account of the creation — commencing with the verse, In the beginning … and concluding with ‘Vayechulu’ (And there were finished) (2:1) — the secret of the Jubilee is already hinted at, namely, “that all things, that came into existence in the beginning of time will be finished in the era of the Jubilee (Beiur Ha’lvush to Ricanti who quotes the language of Ramban). — intimating that in the Jubilee everything is to return [to its origin], every man unto his possession, and every man unto his family.52Further, Verse 10. For it is a sure foundation, and he that believeth53Isaiah 28:16. The verse reads: He that believeth will not ‘yachish’ (make haste). Ramban brings out ingeniously a different meaning by saying: he that believeth ‘yacharish’ (will keep silence), suggesting that the student of Cabala must be reticent and careful not to disclose the secrets he has learned. Cf. the phrase in Amos 5:13 — ‘Therefore ‘hamaskil yidom’. (he who understands will keep quiet)! shall keep silence. This is what is meant in saying, ‘v’shavtah ha’aretz shabbath’ (and ‘the land’ shall keep a Sabbath);54In Verse 2 before us. The word ha’aretz is here understood as “the earth” in its entirety [not merely one particular part of it], the same interpretation applying to the next verses quoted. See further, Note 194. and ye shall proclaim liberty ‘ba’aretz’ (throughout ‘the land’),55Further, Verse 10. for the reference here is to “the land of eternal life” which is alluded to in the first verse [of the Torah],56In the beginning G-d created the heavens ‘v’eth ha’aretz’, which means “the land of eternal life.” and of which it is said, ‘v’ha’aretz ezkor’ (and I will remember ‘the land’).57Further, 26:42. I have already mentioned this several times.58See Vol. I, pp. 110, and 120. Perhaps it is to this that our Rabbis alluded in saying:59Rosh Hashanah 21 b. See also Vol. I, pp. 9-10. “Fifty gates [degrees] of understanding were created in the world, and all were transmitted to Moses with one exception.” For each cycle of seven years constitutes “the gate of one house” [creation], and thus He informed him of all existence from beginning to end, with the exception of the holy Jubilee. \n",

For when the material frame [of human beings] is large and healthy, they can continue [in health] as in the days of Adam.5Adam lived nine hundred and thirty years (Genesis 5:5). See Ramban ibid., on Verse 4, (Vol. I pp. 98-99). Thus this [blessing — the rains in their seasons] is the greatest of all blessings [and therefore it is given first place].Now He said that the heavens will respond to the earth6See Hosea 2:23. with rains in their seasons, and the earth shall respond7See ibid., Verse 24. with its “produce”, which includes vegetation and all moving creatures — cattle, beasts, creeping things and fowl, as well as fish — for the term ha’aretz [“the earth” or “the land,” in and ‘the land’ shall yield her produce] includes the whole of the lower sphere [i.e., everything under the sphere of the moon], just as [in the verses]: In the beginning G-d created the heaven and ‘ha’aretz’ (the earth);8Genesis 1:1. See Ramban ibid., Verse 3 (Vol. I, p. 25) where he discusses this topic fully, and mentions also the verses cited in the following text. And the heaven and ‘ha’aretz’ (the earth) were finished;9Ibid., 2:1. and similarly, Praise the Eternal from ‘ha’aretz’ (the earth), ye sea-monsters and all deeps,10Psalms 148:7. and so also in most verses in Scripture [where this word occurs]. Thus all things created in the lower spheres are “the produce of the earth.” \n",

      "IF THOU BUY A HEBREW SERVANT. G-d began the first ordinance with the subject of a Hebrew servant, because the liberation of the servant in the seventh year contains a rememberance of the departure from Egypt which is mentioned in the first commandment, just as He said on it, And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Eternal thy G-d redeemed thee; therefore I command thee this thing today.21Deuteronomy 15:15. It also contains a remembrance of the creation, just as the Sabbath does, for the seventh year signals to a servant a complete rest from the work of his master, just as the seventh day of the week does. There is in addition a ‘seventh’ amongst the years, which is the jubilee, for seven is the chosen of the days [to be the Sabbath], and of the years [to be the Sabbatical year], and of the [seven] Sabbaticals [to be the jubilee]; and they all point to one subject, namely, the secret of the days of the world — from bereshith (in the beginning) till vayechulu (and they were finished).22Genesis 2:1. See Ramban Vol. I, pp. 61-64. Therefore this commandment deserved to be mentioned first, because of its extreme importance, alluding as it does to great things in the process of creation.23Ramban’s reticent and challenging language is illuminated in an essay by I. Weinstock (B’maglei Haniglah V’hanistar, pp. 151-241) where he traces the development of this Cabalistic doctrine: The universe is subject to cycles of seven thousand years; after each six thousand years of growth and activity the seventh thousand is one of “rest” — destruction. This process repeats itself seven times — representing a total of forty-nine thousand years, the fiftieth thousand being the jubilee when all existence returns to its beginnings. This phenomenon applies to the planet on which we live as well as to the worlds above us. One can thus get a glimpse into the meaning of Ramban’s words before us, that this commandment “alludes to great things in the process of creation.” This is why the prophet Jeremiah was very stringent about it and said, Thus saith the Eternal, the G-d of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers;24Jeremiah 34:13. At the end of the seven years ye shall let go every one his manservant, and every one his maidservant.25Ibid., Verses 14 and 10 (Ramban combined here parts of these verses). And on account of its violation, G-d decreed the exile,26Ibid., Verses 17-22. just as the Torah decreed exile for the Sabbatical rest of the land which was not observed,27Leviticus 26:34-35. as I will yet write,28Ibid., 25:2. with the help of the Rock.When He finished stating the ordinance of this [first] commandment as it applies to Hebrew servants, He began the ordinance of the commandment, Thou shalt not murder,29Above, 20:13. since it is the worst [sin] and then [He stated the ordinances of the commandments] to honor one’s parents, and of Thou shalt not steal,29Above, 20:13. and then He went back to the ordinance of one who smites his fellow-man but did not kill him,30Further, Verses 18-19. and then to the murder of a bondman, which is worse than the killing of an offspring,31See further Verse 22 — that for killing an unborn child a fine is paid, while in the case of the bondman, if he did not survive for twenty-four hours after he was struck by the master, the master is liable to death (Verses 20-21). and after that to [injury to] the limbs of Israelites and bondmen,32Ibid., Verses 24-27. and then to cases of death inflicted by cattle which cause injury.33Ibid., Verses 28-32. All the sections are thus arranged in logical sequence and in proper order. \n",

      "In the beginning Elohim [God] created: Elohim means judge. Indeed, just like the statutes of the Torah are called judgement [or laws]. Similarly, the properties of nature that the Holy One, blessed be He, ingrained in His world are called judgement [or laws]. As is explained in [Tractate] Shabbat 155,  \"'The righteous One knows the judgement of the poor ones' (Proverbs 29:7); the Holy One, blessed be He, knows that that the dog's food [supply] is sparse, etc.;\" and the matter is not in the category of punishment, but rather this is [its] nature, and that is called judgement. And behold [regarding] the name, God/Judge, even though its simple understanding is the One who runs His world in judgement, nonetheless, here, its understanding is the One who creates His world with judgement. And this is its understanding in the Sifri, at the beginning of Parshat Ve'etchanan concerning the prayer of Moshe, \"Lord, God/Judge, in judgement have you created the world.\" And there, we explained with His help, may He be blessed, why the Sages, of blessed memory, explained the intention of Moshe in this way.

      "The heavens and the earth: The clear simple explanation is that which was written by Ramban on verse 8, that [the Torah] is not speaking in this verse about the firmament that would on the second day be called, heavens; and about the dry land that would be called land on the third day. It [follows] from this that the firmament is not intrinsically and inevitably heavens, and so [too] dry land is not inevitably earth; rather [it is only that] the Holy One, blessed be He, called the firmament, heavens, and the dry land, earth; which is not the case in this verse - [instead, here] it is implied that, in essence and to begin with, their qualities are evident; which is that their names are heavens and earth, [even] without being given [these names.] Just like the name, dry land, is not [dependent on its] being given a name, but rather it is self-evident that dry dirt and soil is called dry land, based on its characteristics [and so will be explained about man, later.] And the explanation is that in the beginning of the creation, [it was] His will, may He be blessed, that all the workings of the world should be [by way of] emanator and recipient. An example is the sun and the seven planets that emanate to us. Nonetheless, they receive from what is higher than them. And about what is higher than them, we say in the prayer text, \"who takes out the sun from its place and the moon from its  dwelling place.\" And it is known that the movement of the sun and the moon is not in this fashion, but the intent  is [regarding] the causes of motion of the sun and the moon. And they are called according to their action, as per the explanation of Rambam, of blessed memory, on the Tractate Avodah Zarah - the form of the sun is the 'constellation' of the sun. And behold, all of the emanators [together] are referred to by the name, heavens [shamayim,] because of the letters [that form the combinations], shem, yim: the meaning of shem [name] is the latent potential to emanate; and yim is an even number [to indicate] the plural [form] as with yadayim [hands] and raglayim [feet]; and eretz [earth] indicates the recipient, the nature of which is to run [ratz] to receive the emanation. [And see what I have written in the book of Deuteronomy in Parshat Ha'azinu Hashamayim and in Parshat Berakha on the verse (Deuteronomy 33:28), \"even His heavens drop down dew.\"] And the verse did not explain anything about the highest emanators, since they cannot be fathomed, except by those of great intelligence. And whoever's mind is sharp will find a hint about it all, as it is with everything. And the earth begins from the higher waters, in the midst of which, afterwards God made the firmament. And the potential of the water above the firmament, and its form, was made different than the lower waters, as will be explained.   \n",

      "ברא, “He created;” the term ברא is used on occasion as applying to something which is not of physical substance such as in Numbers 16,30 when Moses predicts that G’d will “create, יברא” a gaping hole in the ground wherever members of Korach’s clan and supporters stood, into which they would disappear. Clearly, the earth’s crust opening into a fissure is not something tangible, something of substance. The word ברא always means that no “matter” was involved in what G’d is described as “creating.” Job 23,13 makes such a point when referring to G’d: ונפשו אותה ויעש, “whatever He desired, He did.” [He does not have to operate within given parameters]. Similarly, Isaiah 43,7 describes G’d as saying: כל העולם הנקרא בשמי ולכבודי בראתיו, יצרתיו, אף עשיתיו, meaning that “the entire world which is called by My name in My honour, is so called in order that people will say that I have created it, I have formed it, I have completed it.” The message is that G’d created it out of “nothing,” not using existing materials. According to the great sage Maimonides, the word לכבודי, may mean “according to My will.” However, one can also understand the word in its literal sense, i.e. that the world and all that is in it represents G’d’s glory. This would conform to Isaiah 6,3 מלא כל הארץ כבודו, “the entire universe is full of His glory.” Seeing that G’d Himself is invisible, we can only recognise Him and His glory by means of His accomplishments, including His creatures. \n",

      "אלוקים. A name which means: Judge, Ruler, and Leader. Seeing that it is a noun occurring in a variety of functions, it is in the plural mode. We find the term applied both to outstanding people, judges, and leaders, also as a description given to certain angels and even planets. During the entire report of G’d’s creative activity it is the only term applied to describe Him, seeing that the chapter deals with His creative power and leadership. From this chapter we derive the knowledge that there are judges on earth and that the entire world was created by a single Creator. He created it in His infinite wisdom when He was ready to create it. In the words of our sages (Bereshit Rabbah 5) anyone who denies this basic fact will find refutation of his denial in the very text of the Torah. For instance, people who argue that the plural mode אלוקים proves that more than one force was involved in the creation of the universe, are confounded by the fact that the Torah does not continue with the plural mode בראו, “they created,” but used the singular mode ברא, “He created.” The great scholar Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra felt that seeing that G’d employed angels, i.e. agents, in His creative activities, the word אלוקים is in the plural mode so as to hint at this fact. \n",

      "את. This word refers to something that had already been created. Our sages (Bereshit Rabbah, 1,15) report that when Rabbi Yishmael asked Rabbi Akiva the meaning of this word in this context, (seeing normally it means something additional) he was told that just as Nachum ish gam zu had made a comprehensive list of every time the word אך or רק appears in the Torah to demonstrate that it excludes something that we would otherwise have assumed to be included, so the word את and גם respectively include something that we would not otherwise have presumed to be included based on the plain text. To the people who use this principle to argue that the planets, the sun and the moon assisted G’d in His creation, based on the apparently unnecessary word את before the word שמים, Rabbi Akiva replied that it means that sun and moon were included in the term “heaven, sky,” whereas the words את הארץ were meant to include the vegetation found on earth, as well as Gan Eden. Concerning the strange sounding addition “and Gan Eden,” after vegetation, i.e. trees and flowers have already been named, we must understand this in a manner similar to Joshua 2,1 את הארץ ואת יריחו, “the country and Jericho,” where Jericho had, of course, been included in the expression את הארץ. The reason that “Gan Eden” was singled out was that there vegetation was at its most developed, most appealing, just as the city of Jericho was known as the city of palms, i.e. especially desirable. There is also a mystical element to this expression, i.e. Gan Eden” represents a region separate from the remainder of the earth, an area which had been created in its full splendour already on the first day of creation, just as according to that view all the eventual manifestations in heaven and earth had already been created on the first day though not yet become a functioning part of the universe. Accordingly, different parts of the universe, became functional on the days when the Torah deals with them.  \n",

      "השמים. Most of our sages (Chagigah 12) understand the word as a reference to the stars and planets in the sky, and Rabbi Maimonides in his “Moreh” agrees that the nine planets including sun and moon were indeed created as part of what is described in our verse as שמים. According to Ibn Ezra the word שמים refers to two locations in the sense of “twice שם,” the word “sham” referring to a location (there). (compare Ibn Ezra on this in a book called ספר השם. The author perceives the term as describing the opposite, outer boundaries of the heavens. The word is used figuratively, as if everything is between the two parts of an anvil) Still other scholars hold that the word השמים referred to with the letter ה, suggesting that it is a known phenomenon, i.e. “the heaven,” in this verse, refers to the firmament which was actually only created on the second day, and that the word is used here only figuratively. These scholars (Rash’bam) hold that the Torah did not mention when the planets were created and not when earth (as distinct from the dry land) was created. [I will not repeat what we have already quoted in our translation of Rash’bam. Ed.] Rashi also agrees that the Torah in its report here did not report in chronological order, but that the reference to “heaven” is a reference to the major planets in the sky. As a result, we would translate: “at the beginning of creation of heaven and earth, the earth was chaotic until G’d gave the directive: ‘let there be light.’ There are still other scholars who understand the expression שמים as referring to “fire,” i.e. the very elementary “fire” the “highest” of the 4 basic elements of which the physical universe is composed. On the other hand, the word ארץ, respectively הארץ, is then understood as the lowest of the 4 elements which form the basic raw material of the physical universe. It would have had to predate “nature,” i.e. the orbiting planets, as “orbiting” is possible only if these orbiting planets have something to rest on. According to some of our sages the fire is a result of the friction created by the motion of these planets when rubbing against their respective bases. Alternatively, we could say that G’d created “beneath” the moon [relative to earth which is considered as subject to the direct influence of the moon, such as the tides; Ed.] a single raw material which He “clothed” in 4 different-looking phenomena, so that the basic raw material of the globe would be a single material, appearing as if cast in a mould. All the phenomena in the sky would have been created simultaneously in their natural state. The reason “light” is mentioned separately is because we would not have understood the report of what transpired on the fourth day, i.e. assigning functions to this “light.” Ibn Ezra also writes in this vein, making the point that what Moses wrote down in the Torah related only to the part of the universe which is subject to development and therefore to disintegration. The word שמים refers to the רקיע, the sky, the firmament whose creation is reported as having occurred on the second “day.” \n",

The word ארץ as distinct from the word שמים, is referred to again in verse 2 as well as in verse 10, seeing that in verse 1 no details had been given of what the word ארץ means, i.e. that it is a phenomenon comprising several basic elements. In other words, whenever ארץ is mentioned after the very first time, it is a reference to some or all of the basic elements it consists of.  \n",

We have already explained that the noun אלוהים is a noun which is sometimes applied to G’d, and sometimes to certain people, and sometimes to phenomena which some people worship even though they have nothing divine about them, In Genesis 1,1 בראשית ברא אלוקים, it is clearly a reference to G’d. In Genesis 20,3 ויבא אלוהים אל אבימלך, it is a reference to an angel, seeing that he carried out a mission on behalf of G’d. In Exodus 22,8 עד האלוהים יבא דבר שניהם, it is a reference to a judge, a human being. The term is also applied to select human beings of a spiritually high level, such as when David quotes G’d in Psalms 82,6 אני אמרתי אלהים אתם, I used to say that you (man) are “divine,” (until you sinned). In our verse here, the Torah in speaking of בני האלוהים, refers to the elite of the human species at the time. In our verse it is a reference to the male elite, the judges. \n",

Thirty years before the birth of Isaac, the covenant between the pieces (at which the above was said) was made, (and after his birth until the exodus four hundred years elapsed.)

(Megillah 9a): Once King Ptolemy assembled seventy-two elders and placed each in a separate house (without telling them why he was doing so), and he said to each of them: \"Transcribe for me [into Greek] the Torah of Moses your teacher.\" The Holy One Blessed be He placed goodly counsel in the heart of each, and they all wrote as one (Genesis 1:1): \"G d created in the beginning\" [so that Ptolemy could not structure the words as: \"In the beginning, god was created.\"] [They wrote] (Ibid. 1:26): \"I will make a man in image and form\" [and not, literally: \"Let us make a man, etc.\", so that he would not be able to argue for a plurality of gods]. [They wrote] (Ibid. 2:2): \"And He finished on the sixth day, and He rested on the seventh day\" [and not, literally: \"And G d finished His work on the seventh day,\" so that he could not argue that G d worked on the seventh day]. [They wrote] (Ibid. 5:2): \"Male and female He created him\" [and not, literally: \"Male and female He created them\" (which Ptolemy could use as an argument for the creation of two separate bodies)]. [They wrote] (Ibid. 11:7): \"Let Me go down and confound their tongue\" [and not, literally: \"Let us go down\", so that he would not find support for his polytheistic views]. [They wrote] (Ibid. 18:12): \"And Sarah laughed bikrovehah\" [\"among her neighbors\", and not, literally: \"bekirbah\" (\"within her\"), so that Ptolemy would not question why Sarah should be punished for laughing, and not Abraham, if they both laughed inwardly]. [They wrote] (Ibid. 49:7): \"For in their wrath they killed an ox\" [instead of: \"a man\" (so as not to give Ptolemy a pretext to call Jews murderers)], \"and in their willfulness they razed a manger\" [instead of: \"an ox\"]. [They wrote] (Exodus 4:20): \"And Moses took his wife and his sons and he rode them on the bearer of men\" [instead of \"on the ass\" (so that he not say that Moses lacked a horse or a camel)]. [They wrote] (Ibid. 12:40): \"And the sojourning of the Jews, their dwelling in Egypt and in other lands was four hundred years.\" [(and not just: \"their dwelling in Egypt,\" as per the verse, which would be open to dispute by Ptolemy's reckoning)]. [They wrote] (Ibid. 24:5): \"And he sent the dignitaries of the children of Israel\" [lest \"youths\" be taken demeaningly]; (Ibid. 11): \"And to the dignitaries of the children of Israel, He did not stretch forth His hand.\" [They wrote] (Numbers 16:15): \"Not one desirable object of theirs\" [(instead of, literally: \"Not one ass of theirs\")] have I taken\" [thus preventing Ptolemy from contending that it was only an ass that Moses had not taken]. [They wrote] (Deuteronomy 4:19): [\"all the host of heaven …] which the L rd your G d bequeathed for illumination to all the peoples under the heavens\" [and not, as in the verse: \"which the L rd your G d bequeathed to all the peoples under the heavens,\" thus preventing him from construing this verse as a license for idolatry]. [They wrote] (Ibid. 17:3): \"and he go and serve other gods … which I did not command to serve\" [instead of, as per the verse: \"which I did not command\", lest he misconstrue it as: \"which I did not command to exist\" (and which \"forced themselves\" into creation against My will)]. And instead of (Leviticus 11:6): \"And the arneveth (hare) […it is unclean to you\"], they wrote: \"the slender-legged\"; for Ptolemy's wife was called \"Arneveth\", and Ptolemy would [otherwise] say: \"The Jews have poked fun at me and put my wife's name in the Torah!\" (Megillah 9a) (Exodus  12:41) \"and it was at the end of four hundred and thirty years\": We are hereby apprised that when the time arrived, the L rd did not delay them for one moment. On the fifteenth of Nissan the ministering angels came to Abraham to apprise him (that Isaac would be born); (on the fifteenth of Nissan he was born) and on the fifteenth of Nissan the decree went forth (in the covenant) between the pieces, it being written \"And it was at the end\" — there was one end for all of them. \"and it was on this very same day that all the hosts of the L rd went forth\": (The Shechinah, too, went forth with them.) And thus do you find, that whenever Israel is in bondage, the Shechinah is with them, viz. (Exodus  24:10) \"And they saw the G d of Israel, and under His feet, as the work of a sapphire brick\" (the sign of that bondage). And what is written of their redemption? (Ibid.) \"and as the appearance of the heavens in brightness.\" And it is written (Isaiah 63:9) \"In all of their sorrows, He sorrowed.\" This tells me only of communal sorrows. Whence do I derive (the same for) those of the individual? From (Psalms 91:15) \"He will call upon Me and I will answer Him; I am with him in sorrow,\" and (Genesis 39:20-21) \"And Joseph's master took him and placed him in the prison house … and the L rd was with Joseph, etc.\", and (II Samuel  7:23) \"… before Your people whom You have redeemed from Egypt, a nation and its G d.\" R. Eliezer says: Idolatry passed with Israel in the sea, viz. (Zechariah 10:11) \"And a 'rival' passed in the sea, and struck waves in the sea.\" Which was that? The idol of Michah (viz. Shoftim 17:4). R. Akiva said (on II Samuel 7:23): Were it not explicitly written, it would be impossible to say it, Israel  saying before the L rd, as it were, \"You redeemed Yourself!\" And thus do you find, that wherever they were exiled, the Shechinah was with them. They were exiled to Egypt — the Shechinah was with them, viz. (I Samuel 2:27) \"Did I not reveal Myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt? They were exiled to Bavel — the Shechinah was with them, viz. (Isaiah 43:14) \"For your sake I was exiled to Bavel.\" They were exiled to Eilam — the Shechinah was with them, viz. (Jeremiah 49:38) \"and I set My throne in Eilam.\" They were exiled to Edom — the Shechinah was with them, viz. (Isaiah 63:1) \"Who is This coming from Edom, His garments crimsoned, from Batzrah?\" And when they return in the future, the Shechinah will be with them, viz. (Devarim 30:3) \"And veshav the L rd your G d.\" It is not written \"veheshiv\" (\"He will return\" [you]), but \"veshav\" (\"He [Himself] will return.\") and it is written (Song of Songs 4:8) \"With Me from Levanon (the Temple), My bride (Israel); with Me from Levanon come.\" Now is she (Israel) coming from Levanon?

The words erez, mayim, ruaḥ, and ḥoshek in the second verse (ch. i.), are homonyms and denote the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire; in other instances erez is the terrestrial globe, mayim is water or vapour, ruaḥ denotes wind, and ḥoshek darkness: According to Maimonides, a summary of the first chapter may be given thus; God created the Universe by producing first the reshit the \"beginning\" (Gen. 1:1), or hatḥalah, i.e., the intellects which give to the spheres both existence and motion, and thus become the source of the existence of the entire Universe. At first this Universe consisted of a chaos of elements, but its form was successively developed by the influence of the spheres, and more directly by the action of light and darkness, the properties of which were fixed on the first day of the Creation. In the subsequent five days minerals, plants, animals, and the intellectual beings came into existence. The seventh day, on which the Universe was for the first time ruled by the same natural laws which still continue in operation, was distinguished as a day blessed and sanctified by the Creator, who designed it to proclaim the creatio ex nihilo (Exod. xx. xi). The Israelites were moreover commanded to keep this Sabbath in commemoration of their departure from Egypt (Deut. v. ii), because during the period of the Egyptian bondage, they had not been permitted to rest on that day. In the history of the first sin of man, Adam, Eve, and the serpent represent the intellect, the body, and the imagination. In order to complete the imagery, Samael or Satan, mentioned in the Midrash in connexion with this account, is added as representing man's appetitive faculties. Imagination, the source of error, is directly aided by the appetitive faculty, and the two are intimately connected with the body, so which man generally gives paramount attention, and for the sake of which he indulges in sins; in the end, however, they subdue the intellect and weaken its power. Instead of obtaining pure and real knowledge, man forms false conceptions; in consequence, the body is subject to suffering, whilst the imagination, instead of being guided by the intellect and attaining a higher development becomes debased and depraved. In the three sons of Adam, Kain, Abel, and Seth, Maimonides finds an allusion to the three elements in man: the vegetable, the animal, and the intellectual. First, the animal element (Abel) becomes extinct; then the vegetable elements (Kain) are dissolved; only the third element, the intellect (Seth), survives, and forms the basis of mankind (ch. xxx., xxxi.). \n",

      "The degrees in the perfection of men vary according to these distinctions. Concerning those who never beheld the light even for one day, but walk in continual darkness, it is written, \"They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness\" (Ps. 82:5). Truth, in spite of all its powerful manifestations, is completely withheld from them, and the following words of Scripture may be applied to them, \"And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies\" (Job 37:21). They are the multitude of ordinary men: there is no need to notice them in this treatise. You must know that if a person, who has attained a certain degree of perfection, wishes to impart to others, either orally or in writing, any portion of the knowledge which he has acquired of these subjects, he is utterly unable to be as systematic and explicit as he could be in a science of which the method is well known. The same difficulties which he encountered when investigating the subject for himself will attend him when endeavouring to instruct others: viz., at one time the explanation will appear lucid, at another time, obscure: this property of the subject appears to remain the same both to the advanced scholar and to the beginner. For this reason, great theological scholars gave instruction in all such matters only by means of metaphors and allegories. They frequently employed them in forms varying more or less essentially. In most cases they placed the lesson to be illustrated at the beginning, or in the middle, or at the end of the simile. When they could find no simile which from beginning to end corresponded to the idea which was to be illustrated, they divided the subject of the lesson, although in itself one whole, into different parts, and expressed each by a separate figure. Still more obscure are those instances in which one simile is employed to illustrate many subjects, the beginning of the simile representing one thing, the end another. Sometimes the whole metaphor may refer to two cognate subjects in the same branch of knowledge. If we were to teach in these disciplines, without the use of parables and figures, we should be compelled to resort to expressions both profound and transcendental, and by no means more intelligible than metaphors and similes: as though the wise and learned were drawn into this course by the Divine Will, in the same way as they are compelled to follow the laws of nature in matters relating to the body. You are no doubt aware that the Almighty, desiring to lead us to perfection and to improve our state of society, has revealed to us laws which are to regulate our actions. These laws, however, presuppose an advanced state of intellectual culture. We must first form a conception of the Existence of the Creator according to our capabilities; that is, we must have a knowledge of Metaphysics. But this discipline can only be approached after the study of Physics: for the science of Physics borders on Metaphysics, and must even precede it in the course of our studies, as is clear to all who are familiar with these questions. Therefore the Almighty commenced Holy Writ with the description of the Creation, that is, with Physical Science; the subject being on the one hand most weighty and important, and on the other hand our means of fully comprehending those great problems being limited. He described those profound truths, which His Divine Wisdom found it necessary to communicate to us, in allegorical, figurative, and metaphorical language. Our Sages have said (Yemen Midrash on Gen. 1:1), \"It is impossible to give a full account of the Creation to man. Therefore Scripture simply tells us, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth\" (Gen. 1:1). Thus they have suggested that this subject is a deep mystery, and in the words of Solomon, \"Far off and exceedingly deep, who can find it out?\" (Eccles. 7:24). It has been treated in metaphors in order that the uneducated may comprehend it according to the measure of their faculties and the feebleness of their apprehension, while educated persons may take it in a different sense. In our commentary on the Mishnah we stated our intention to explain difficult problems in the Book on Prophecy and in the Book of Harmony. In the latter we intended to examine all the passages in the Midrash which, if taken literally, appear to be inconsistent with truth and common sense, and must therefore be taken figuratively. Many years have elapsed since I first commenced those works. I had proceeded but a short way when I became dissatisfied with my original plan. For I observed that by expounding these passages by means of allegorical and mystical terms, we do not explain anything, but merely substitute one thing for another of the same nature, whilst in explaining them fully our efforts would displease most people; and my sole object in planning to write those books was to make the contents of Midrashim and the exoteric lessons of the prophecies intelligible to everybody. We have further noticed that when an ill-informed Theologian reads these Midrashim, he will find no difficulty; for possessing no knowledge of the properties of things, he will not reject statements which involve impossibilities. When, however, a person who is both religious and well educated reads them, he cannot escape the following dilemma: either he takes them literally, and questions the abilities of the author and the soundness of his mind-doing thereby nothing which is opposed to the principles of our faith,--or he will acquiesce in assuming that the passages in question have some secret meaning, and he will continue to hold the author in high estimation whether he understood the allegory or not. As regards prophecy in its various degrees and the different metaphors used in the prophetic books, we shall give in the present work an explanation, according to a different method. Guided by these considerations I have refrained from writing those two books as I had previously intended. In my larger work, the Mishnah Torah, I have contented myself with briefly stating the principles of our faith and its fundamental truths, together with such hints as approach a clear exposition. In this work, however, I address those who have studied philosophy and have acquired sound knowledge, and who while firm in religious matters are perplexed and bewildered on account of the ambiguous and figurative expressions employed in the holy writings. Some chapters may be found in this work which contain no reference whatever to homonyms. Such chapters will serve as an introduction to others: they will contain some reference to the signification of a homonym which I do not wish to mention in that place, or explain some figure: point out that a certain expression is a figure: treat of difficult passages generally misunderstood in consequence of the homonymy they include, or because the simile they contain is taken in place of that which it represents, and vice versâ. \n",

      "THE CREATION ON THE SECOND DAY ON the second day the Holy One, blessed be He, created the firmament, the angels, fire for flesh and blood, and the fire of Gehinnom. Were not heaven and earth created on the first day, as it is said, \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth\" (Gen. 1:1)? Which firmament was created on the second day? Rabbi Eliezer said: || It was the firmament which is above the heads of the four Chajjôth (living creatures), (as it is said), \"And over the head of the Chajjôth there was the likeness of a firmament, like the colour of the terrible crystal\" (Ezek. 1:22). What is the meaning of (the expression), \"like the colour of the terrible crystal\"? It means like precious stones and pearls; it illuminates all the heavens like a lamp which is illuminating the whole house and like the sun which is shining with maximum intensity at noonday, as it is said, \"The light dwelleth with him\" (Dan. 2:22); and like this in the future will the righteous shed light, as it is said, \"And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament\" (Dan. 12:3). Were it not for that firmament the world would be engulfed by the waters above it and below it; but (the firmament) divides the waters (above) from the waters (below), as it is said, \"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, (and let it divide the waters from the waters)\" (Gen. 1:6), it illuminates between the waters above and the waters below. \n",

The School of Hillel said: The earth was created first, and the heavens afterwards, as it is said, \"Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands\" (Ps. 102:25). The School of Shammai said: The heavens were created first, and the earth afterwards, as it is said, \"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth\" (Gen. 2:4). The School of Hillel said: The earth was created first, and the heavens afterwards, as it is said, \"In the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven\" (ibid.).

Variantly: \"awesome in praise\": The measure of flesh and blood — A man's awe is more upon those who are distant from him than upon those who are near him. Not so, the Holy One Blessed be He. His awe is more upon those near to Him than upon those distant from Him, viz. (Leviticus 10:3) \"Among those near to Me will I be sanctified\", and (Psalms 50:3) \"and those around Him were greatly shaken\", and (Ibid. 89:8) \"He is awesome upon all around Him\", and (Ibid. 9) \"O L rd, G d of hosts, who, like You, is mighty, O L rd? Your faith is (upon all) who surround You.\" The measure of flesh and blood — When one man works for another — plowing with him, sowing with him, weeding with him, hoeing with him — the other gives him a single coin and he goes on his way. Not so, the Holy One Blessed be He. If a man desires children, He gives him children, viz. (Psalms 127:3) \"The inheritance of the L rd is children.\" If he desires wisdom, He gives it to him, viz. (Mishlei 2:6) \"for the L rd gives wisdom.\" If he desires attainments, He gives them to him, viz. (I Chronicles 29:12) \"Wealth and honor (come) from before You.\" The measure of flesh and blood — First he builds the lower; then the higher. But the Holy One Blessed be He — First He builds the higher; then the lower, viz. (Genesis 1:1) \"In the beginning G d created the heavens, (and then) the earth.\" The measure of flesh and blood — he roofs (his chambers) with wood, earth, and stones. But the Holy One Blessed be He roofs His world with water, viz. (Psalms 104:3) \"He roofs His upper (chambers) with water, etc.\" The measure of flesh and blood — he cannot make a form from water. But the Holy One Blessed be He does make a form from water, viz. (Genesis 1:20) \"Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, etc.\" The measure of flesh and blood — he cannot make a form from earth. But the Holy One Blessed be He does make a form from earth, viz. (Psalms 139:15) \"I was wrought in secrecy, knit together in the recesses of the earth, etc.\" The measure of flesh and blood — When he comes to make a figure, he begins from the head or from one of the limbs, and then completes it. But the Holy One Blessed be He forms all as one, viz. (Jeremiah 10:16) \"For He is the former of all.\" And it is written (I Samuel 2:2) \"There is no rock (\"tzur\") like our G d\" — There is no artist (\"tzayar\") like our G d. The measure of flesh and blood — he goes to an artisan and tells him: Make me a figure of my father, and he says: Let your father come and pose for me or bring me a likeness of him and I will do so. Not so, the Holy One Blessed be He. He gives a man a son from a drop of water — and it is like the likeness of his father! \n",

      "... Teach us o teacher: toward where should one who prays orient his heart? This is what our Rabbis taught: one should orient his heart toward the place of the Holy of Holies (Berachot 4:5). R’ Eliezer ben Yaakov says: if one is praying outside of the land, he should orient his heart to the land of Israel. If one is praying within the land of Israel, he should orient his heart to Jerusalem. If one is praying in Jerusalem, he should orient his heart to the Holy Temple. If one is praying in the Holy Temple, he should orient his heart to the Holy of Holies. R’ Avin the Levi said: “our neck is like the Tower of David, built as a model (talpiyot)…” (Song of Songs 4:4) What does talpiyot mean? The hill (tel) toward which all turns (peniyot) are directed.

      "Man — what is he in this God-filled world? What is his place in this throng of creatures of God, this choir of servants of the Lord? Though the Torah were silent, would not the contemplation of creation, would not your own breast tell you? Man, is he not also a creature of God? Should he not also be a servant of God? Every fiber of your body is a creation from the hand of God, formed by Him, arranged by Him, endowed by Him with power. Your spirit, that world of powers, is the creation of God from beginning to end. The divine spark, your personality, which, invisible as Deity, weaves and works in this microcosm, and under whose control stand intellect and body and the power to use the entire realm of nature for its purpose, this mysterious spritual force in you is itself emanation of Deity. Learn to deem yourself holy as creature of God and, while contemplating heaven and earth and the great chorus of servants of the Lord, consecrate yourself to your mission, and proclaim yourself with mingled solemnity and joy, \"servant of God!\" Since all things, the smallest and the greatest, are God's chosen messengers, to work, each in its place, and with its measure of power, according to the law of the Most High, taking only that it may give again, should man alone be excluded from this circle of blessed activity? Can he be born only to take? — to revel in lavish plenty or to starve in misery, but not to work? — not to fill any place, nor fulfill any purpose, but to let all end in himself? The world and all which is therein serves God; is it conceivable that man alone should only serve himself? No! Your consciousness pronounces you as does the Torah, צלם אלהים \"an image of God.\" That is what man should be. Only when working out some end canst thou know God in love and righteousness; to work out ends of righteousness and love art thou called; not merely to enjoy or suffer. All which thou possessest, spirit, body, human beings, wealth, every ability and every power, they are means of activity; לעבדה ולשמרה to promote and preserve the world were they given — love and righteousness. Not thine is the earth, but thou belongest to the earth, to respect it as Divine soil and to deem every one of its creatures a creature of God, thy fellow-being; to respect and love it as such, and as such to endeavor to bring it nearer to its goal, according to the will of God. For this reason every being impresses upon thy spirit an image of itself; for this reason thy heart-strings pulsate sympathetically with every cry of distress heard anywhere in creation, or with every tone of joy which issues anywhere from a gladsome being; therefore thou rejoicest when the flower blooms and sorrowest when it fades. The law to which all powers submit unconsciously and involuntarily, to it shall thou also subordinate thyself, but consciously and of thy own free will. \"Knowledge and freedom,'\" these words indicate at once the sublime mission and the lofty privilege of man. All forces stand as servitors around the throne of God, their capacity is hidden from themselves and covered are their countenances, so that they can not see the reason of their mission, but they feel within them winged power to act, and act in accordance with their purpose. Thou, O man, thy countenance is half uncovered, thy capacity is half revealed, thou canst comprehend thyself as creature of God — canst at least faintly appreciate the notion of the mission which He breathed into thy ear; canst thou see thyself encompassed round about by God's active servants, canst thou feel in thyself power to act and wilt thou not joyously join in the cry of the great chorus of servants,  נעשה ונשמע  \"we will do and therefore hearken? We will obey, and fulfilling strive to comprehend the import of the command!\" Consciously and freely! Therefore thou shalt be first and highest servitor in the company of servants! \n",

      "This point is made even more clearly in Genesis 13,14 where ‎we read: ‎וה' אמר אל אברם אחרי הפרד לוט מעמו שא נא עיניך וראה מן ‏המקום אשר אתה שם צפונה ונגבה וקדמה וימה‎, \"and the Lord had said to ‎Avram after Lot had separated from him ‘raise your eyes and look ‎northward, southward, eastward and westward;’” this was a ‎promise first and foremost that he would see in his lifetime three ‎of the patriarchs of the Jewish people, i.e. himself, Yitzchok, and ‎Yaakov. The first three directions mentioned here symbolize the ‎attributes ‎חסד‎ ‎‏, גבורה, ‏and ‎תפארת‎, referring to Avraham, Yitzchok ‎and Yaakov in that order.When telling Avraham that he ‎would see ‎את כל הארץ‎, “the whole of the land” (future Eretz ‎Yisrael), this refers to David, whose attribute is ‎מלכות‎, Royalty, ‎David representing this symbol on earth, the Jewish people. David ‎is directly linked to the patriarch Avraham, was shown “the ‎whole land,” so that he would be aware that the glory of the ‎Kingdom of David would be directly traceable to him. This is the ‎reason why north and south, east and west are listed here in this ‎order. According to Ari za’l, ‎ימה‎, “west,” refers to the ‎emanation ‎יסוד‎, the emanation directly above the emanation ‎מלכות‎, the one symbolized by the kingdom of ‎David.[Malchut, as the “lowest” of the emanations, is ‎the one closest to the physical universe. Rabbi Elie Munk (Ascent ‎to Harmony) has described the emanation Malchut as ‎‎“History” (of man), thus seeing it as the bridge between the ‎actual physical universe and the celestial domains, since when ‎something becomes “history,” it has either receded or ascended ‎‎(depending on whether the persons making history made ‎constructive or destructive contributions) to a domain beyond ‎the physical but robbing it of the “substance” common to ‎phenomena in the earthly domain of the universe. ‎Ed.]According to the Zohar, tzaddik and tzedek, ‎the righteous person and the performance of righteous deeds, are ‎indivisible, i.e. the emanations ‎מלכות‎ and ‎יסוד‎ always go hand in ‎hand. We find this concept first alluded to in the Torah when ‎‎Malki Tzedek, King of Shalem, (Jerusalem) in Genesis 14,18 ‎congratulates Avram on his victory, blesses him in the name of ‎the Lord, and presents him with bread and wine. The word ‎לחם‎, ‎commonly understood as “bread,” is used to describe ‎חכמה‎, ‎‎“wisdom,” whereas the word ‎יין‎, commonly understood as “wine” ‎means ‎בינה‎, “insight,” in this context. Malki Tzedek presented ‎these items as symbols of the two highest emanations man can ‎usually attain, both of which Avraham employed in his service of ‎the Lord. [As on previous occasions, the author sees in such ‎apparently irrelevant details as a King bringing bread and wine ‎from hundreds of kilometers from Jerusalem. According to Genesis ‎‎14,15, Avraham had pursued the armies of Kedorleomer all the ‎way to Damascus) an allusion to something far more profound. ‎Ed.]The Zohar I,199 traces the fact that a tzaddik ‎serves the Lord with ‎חכמה‎ and ‎בינה‎ to Job 28,28 ‎יראת ה' היא חכמה ‏וסור מרע בינה‎, “Reverence for the Lord is wisdom, to shun evil is ‎understanding, insight.” The two blessings that Malki Tzedek, ‎who was viewed as G’d’s High Priest in those days, most likely ‎Shem, Noach’s oldest son, bestowed on Avram, represent the two ‎emanations that Avram had been able to use in his service of the ‎Lord, and are reflected in Targum Yonathan’s translation of the ‎Torah, in the first verses of the Torah in which they appear. [In ‎our verses, instead of commending Avraham to G’d, as we would ‎translate the words ‎ברוך אברם ל..‏‎, Yonathan ben Uzziel translates: ‎ברוך אברם מ...‏‎, “Avram has been blessed by the supreme G’d, etc.” ‎Ed.] Targum Yerushalmi translates already the first words of the ‎Torah, i.e. ‎בראשית ברא אלוקים את השמים ואת הארץ‎, as “in the ‎beginning G’d used the emanation of ‎חכמה‎ to create heaven and ‎earth.” ‎ \n",

      "Exodus 8,5.Moses said to Pharaoh: ‎‎‘you may brag concerning me, ‘for when shall I ‎pray on your behalf, etc;?” ‎ויאמר למחר, ויאמר כדבריך ‏למען תדע כי אין כה' אלוקינו‎ “He said: ‘for tomorrow!” ‎He replied: ‘just as you have said, so that you ‎will know that there is no-one comparable to the ‎Lord our G’d.’” It is worth noting that after the fourth ‎plague, (the third not having been announced ‎beforehand) in announcing the forthcoming plague, ‎‎(Exodus 8,18) G’d uses the expression: ‎והפלאתי‎ when ‎announcing beforehand that the wild beasts will not ‎invade the land of Goshen, the home of most of the ‎Children of Israel. At that point, Moses adds to his ‎warning: “in order that you will know that there is no-‎one comparable to Me on the whole Earth.” A similar ‎statement appears before the onset of the plague of ‎hail, (9,14) and prior to Moses leaving the boundaries ‎of the land of Egypt in order to pray to G’d to bring the ‎plague of hail to a conclusion. (Exodus 9,29) Moses ‎adds that his objective is to demonstrate to Pharaoh ‎that the globe is G’d’s property, ‎‏ למען תדע כי לה' הארץ‎. We ‎need to examine why G’d chose to use different ‎reasons for the onset or removal of the various ‎plagues we quoted.‎With G’d’s help we hope to clarify the reasons ‎behind these various nuances that appear so ‎significant that the Torah bothers to list them ‎individually.‎The Zohar, in commenting on the verse: ‎אני ‏ראשון ואני אחרון  ומבלעדי אין אלוקים‎, “I am the first and I am ‎the last and apart from Me there is no Divine ‎power,”(Isaiah 44,6) sees in that verse a synopsis of the ‎functions of certain vowels (all three are dots but ‎placed on top, in the middle, or beneath the ‎consonants) If the dot is on top of the letter, as in the ‎חולם‎, it refers to the ability of the Tzaddikim to ‎cause decrees by the attribute of Justice to be ‎converted to decrees dominated by the attribute of ‎Mercy, the reason being that the concept of the Jewish ‎nation had preceded the concept of creating a physical ‎universe in G’d’s mind. The same dot appearing in the ‎middle of the letter, known as ‎שורוק‎, alludes to G’d’s ‎intervention in the affairs of man in a covert manner, ‎as He did during the period of Mordechai and Esther. ‎Finally, the dot appearing  beneath the letter, known as ‎חיריק‎, alludes to the period of the wars preceding the ‎arrival of the messiah when G’d will become manifest ‎by His literally “turning the world upside down”, ‎pouring out the wicked, who at that time will finally ‎recognize His might in all its glory. The author derives ‎all of this from the concise comments of the ‎‎Zohar on the verse we quoted from Isaiah ‎‎44,6. ‎ \n",

Seeing that, -as he ‎has told us repeatedly,- the various universes have ‎been created only for the sake of the Jewish people, as ‎‎Rashi already commented on the opening ‎words of the Torah, ‎בראשית ברא‎, it follows that when, G’d ‎forbid, hard times hit the Jewish people, the “days” ‎themselves must come to the assistance of the Jewish ‎people and point out good deeds of this people to G’d, ‎as, if we were G’d forbid to disappear, so would these ‎‎“days,” i.e. all of the world’s history would disappear ‎with the Jewish people. The expression ‎ביום ההוא‎, “on ‎that day” in our verse, therefore refers to the “day” on ‎which the collective soul of the universe praised the ‎Jewish people to forestall its defeat at the hands of the ‎Egyptians.‎ \n",

      "Exodus 38,21. “These are the accounts of the Tabernacle of ‎the Testimony that were rendered according to the ‎commandment of Moses, etc.;” we have already written ‎previously that the construction of the Tabernacle required holy ‎spirit and the knowledge of how G’d used the aleph bet, i.e. ‎the letters of the Torah and their respective combinations that ‎G’d used when He created heaven and earth. (based on ‎‎Yevamot  47). The subject has been elaborated on further in ‎‎Bereshit Rabbah section 12,14 which quotes the school of ‎Shammai saying that the idea to create the universe crystallized ‎in G’d’s mind at night whereas the execution occurred by day, ‎and that the letter ‎ה‎ written in smaller script in Genesis  2,4 in ‎the word ‎בהבראם‎ is an allusion to the attribute ‎א-ד-נ-י‎, one of G’d’s ‎names, whereas afterwards in the same verse when the Torah ‎writes ‎ביום עשות ה' אלוקים ארץ ושמים‎, “on the day that ‎‎&lt;ihashem&lt; i=\"\"&gt; made earth and heaven,” the  apparent repetition is ‎an allusion to the fact that G’d is unique and the exclusive ‎Creator. [Our author must have had a different version of ‎the Bereshit rabbah, as the second comment concerning the ‎attribute ‎א-ד-נ-י‎ is not found in my updated version of that ‎‎Midrash. Ed.]‎The uniqueness of both Moses and Betzalel paralleled the ‎description of unique attributes possessed by the Creator. ‎Initially, the instructions given by Moses to Betzalel were similar ‎to G’d’s formulating the thought of creating a universe, whereas ‎the execution paralleled the words ‎ביום עשות ה' אלוקים‎, G’d in His ‎capacity as Hashem carrying out His plan to create the ‎universe. The numerical value of the first letters of the  opening ‎words in our portion, ‎אלה פקודי המשכן‎ i.e. ‎א'פ'ה'‏‎ have a combined ‎value of 86, equivalent to the letters in the name of G’d when it is ‎spelled ‎א-ל-ה-י-ם‎, i.e. His attribute of ‎א-ד-נ-י‎, the word signifying ‎the attribute of Justice. The respective last letters in the same ‎sequence of words are ‎ה'י'נ‎ equaling 65, or the numerical value of ‎the attribute ‎א-ד-נ-י‎. When we examine the respective first and ‎final letters in the second half of the introductory verse of our ‎portion, i.e. ‎משכן העדות‎, we find that the letters ‎מ'ה‎ correspond to ‎the holy name of G’d consisting of 45 letters, whereas the final ‎letters in these words, i.e. ‎ת'נ‎ or 450 i.e. ten times the value of the ‎opening letters. This suggests that whereas Betzalel was indeed ‎granted great insights, it was Moses, ‎אשר פקד על פי משה‎ who had ‎the highest level of understanding how to manipulate all the ‎letters in the names of G’d‏. \n",

      "Leviticus 23,15. “you shall count for yourselves from ‎the day following the festival, (Passover) etc.;” we need to ‎understand first of all why the festival of Passover is referred to as ‎‎Hashabbat in our verse. This has been explained by our ‎sages, (Tanna de bey Eliyahu 14) where the author interprets ‎the word ‎בראשית‎ as meaning ‎בשביל ישראל‎, “for the sake of Israel.” ‎Granted that this is true, it did however, not come to the ‎attention of the world until G’d redeemed Israel from Egypt when ‎His love for His people manifested itself. As a result, Passover ‎became similar to the Sabbath. The Sabbath is unique as on the ‎Sabbath G’d abstained from His creative activity, whereas, ‎according to the Zohar, on Passover He abstained from ‎entertaining thoughts. When G’d “rested” on the original Sabbath ‎His work during the preceding six days was revealed for the first ‎time. Similarly, His love for the Jewish people was revealed for the ‎first time on the occasion of the redemption from Egypt, i.e. the ‎day of the Exodus. On the first day of Passover it finally became ‎clear why G’d had bothered to create the universe altogether. In ‎other words, Passover may be looked upon as the logical ‎conclusion of what had been set in motion the moment G’d had ‎first thought of the people of Israel as a project for the future. ‎This is also the meaning of a statement of the sages in Shabbat ‎‎118 that if the Israelites were to observe two Sabbath days, i.e. ‎the terrestrial Sabbath as well as the celestial Sabbath, they would ‎be redeemed immediately. The scholar to whom this statement is ‎attributed quoted Isaiah 56,4 in support, where G’d promises ‎redemption to the eunuchs who keep His Sabbaths, following up ‎in verse 7 with: “and I will bring them to the Mountain of My ‎holiness  etc,. etc.” The “two” Sabbaths of which the Talmud ‎speaks are not to be understood quantitatively, i.e. 2 separate ‎Sabbath days, but refer to the ‎שבת תחתון‎ and the ‎שבט עליון‎, ‎observance of the Sabbath with our body, i.e. ‎תחתון‎, and at the ‎same time observing it with our hearts and minds, i.e. ‎שבת עליון‎, ‎the Sabbath in our upper regions, our heads. The more the ‎Israelites engage in serving the Lord, the clearer it will become ‎that G’d only created the universe on account of the Israelites. ‎There is an allusion to this in the letters of the words ‎מן פסח‎ ‎when we reverse the order of the aleph bet, i.e. that the ‎letter ‎א=ת, ב-ש, ג=ר‎ etc. [Magen Avraham on the laws ‎of the New Moon chapter 428, subsection 3 deals with this in ‎greater detail, i.e. that certain festivals must occur on the ‎weekdays corresponding to other festivals preceding them during ‎the same year.

      "Numbers 21,17. “then Israel sang this song: ‘come up, ‎well sing to it- the well which chieftains dug which the ‎nobles of the people started, etc;’” We need to understand ‎why the song that the people under the leadership of Moses sang ‎after the drowning of the Egyptians in the sea, were words that ‎we could easily understand, whereas this song is shrouded in ‎mystical allusions none of which are easy to decipher.‎The answer to this question may lie in the fact that at the sea ‎of Reeds, Moses had seen revelations by G’d in what is known as ‎אספקלריא המאירה‎, “a clear vision” (compare Yevamot 49) so ‎that he could announce his prophecies without having to resort ‎to allusions.‎The song we read here was not composed by Moses, but the ‎Torah wrote: “then Israel sung, etc.” In other words, the people ‎had been divinely inspired, but being only people, not Moses, ‎they had seen prophetic insights only through the prism of ‎אספקלריא שאיננה מאירה‎, a vision which was distorted through ‎reflections. Rashi on 21,20 already asks the question why ‎the name of Moses is not mentioned in this paragraph. He ‎answers that the reason is that on account of this well, or rather ‎its having failed after Miriam’s death having caused him to be ‎punished, it would not have been fitting to associate his name ‎when  singing the praises of this well.‎Let us now proceed to explain the allusions contained in this ‎poetic song extolling the well.‎Sometimes G’d will perform a miracle for the Israelites in ‎response to their cry to Him for help, and this is the manner in ‎which He responds to their outcry. The splitting of the sea of ‎Reeds at the time was an example of G’d’s responding by means of ‎an impressive miracle. We have read in Exodus 14,10: ‎ויצעקו בני ‏ישראל וגו'‏‎, “the Israelites cried out, etc,”  The splitting of the sea ‎was G’d’s response to that outcry.‎On other occasions G’d performs a miracle for the people ‎without their being in need, i.e. according to their perception. ‎The people had not even been aware at that time that deadly ‎danger was near them. When wondering why G’d had performed a ‎miracle for them, they investigated what danger could have ‎lurked near them without their having been aware of it. This was ‎the case in the paragraph above where the people only belatedly ‎became aware of the Canaanites that G’d had killed.‎We are entitled to ask what prompted G’d to reveal these ‎details in the Torah which Rashi describes as the Canaanites ‎having been hidden in clefts of rock overhanging the Arnon river ‎that were invisible to people passing underneath along its banks. ‎In the kedushah formula according to the Sefardi ‎nussach which begins with the word: ‎כתר‎, we encounter the ‎line ‎הן גאלתי אתכם אחרית כראשית‎, “see I will redeem you in the ‎future just as I have redeemed you in the past.” At first glance ‎this does not seem much of a promise; we had surely hoped that ‎the ultimate redemption will be something far superior to the ‎partial redemptions we have experienced from time to time! In ‎light of that why would the author of this line link the final ‎redemption to previous redemptions? Who has ever heard of the ‎major event being linked to the minor event?‎Did not our sages (Tannah de bey Eliyahu 14) state that ‎the meaning of the opening word of the Torah, ‎בראשית‎ is ‎בשביל ‏ראשית‎, “on account of the people of Israel who are called ‎ראשית‎, ‎the Lord created heaven and earth?” If all parts of the universe ‎were created on account of the Jewish people, this surely means ‎that there is a constant injection of additional essence of life into ‎the earth itself, on account of the pre-eminence of the Jewish ‎people? It would follow that the earth is therefore obligated to ‎conform to the expressed will of the Jewish people, since its very ‎existence hinges on the well being of the Jewish people. Keeping ‎the universe in a condition that ensures its continued existence, ‎i.e. ‎תקון העולם‎ is the earth’s self interest.‎It is true that only after the final stage of the universe’s ‎creation had been revealed, i.e. the earth and its inhabitants, had ‎it become clear what had been in the mind of the Creator from ‎the moment He had contemplated creating a universe. At that ‎time all could see that the intervening stages of creation had all ‎been leading up to the creation of the Jewish people as the ‎crowning achievement. This is what the author of the line we ‎quoted from the kedushah had in mind when he wrote: ‎אתכם אחרית כראשית‎, “you in the end as at the beginning.” Only ‎after the final redemption will G’d’s plan for the Jewish people ‎become revealed as having been His plan from the earliest ‎moment of the creative process. ‎As long as Jewish history on this earth has not yet come to its ‎successful conclusion (history in the sense of development) G’d’s ‎original intentions could not have become manifest to one and ‎all. During the period leading up to this point in Jewish history ‎miracles have to be performed at the request of the Jewish ‎people. Once that period has passed successfully, miracles will be ‎performed by nature on behalf of the Jewish people without their ‎having to ask for them. The day (not literally) prior to the ‎revelation at Mount Sinai, when the design of G’d that the Jewish ‎people are the objective of His creation of the universe had ‎become manifest, this had not yet been common knowledge. This ‎is why we read in Exodus 14,10 when Pharaoh had caught up ‎with the Israelites, that ‎ויצעקו בני ישראל‎, “the Children of Israel ‎cried out,” i.e. asked to be saved by means of a miracle. Now at ‎the time of or after the giving of the Torah when G’d’s original ‎plan that His people would be the Jewish people had become well ‎known, there was no need for them to cry out even if the enemy ‎had lain in ambush. At this time and subsequently, the earth, for ‎reasons of self preservation, would not allow fatal harm to befall ‎Israel as it would suffer the consequences itself. Calling on the ‎source of water to arise, i.e. to become manifest, was therefore a ‎command directed at the earth rather than to G’d.The Israelites reminded the earth of its self-interest in ‎providing the Jewish people with a source of water for their needs ‎in the desert. This is what Rashi had in mind when he ‎commented on the words ‎ענו לה‎, (verse 14-15) that the mountain ‎addressed was part of Eretz Yisrael.  The song was in ‎recognition of what the earth had done, (performed miracles) on ‎behalf of the Jewish people without having been asked to do so.‎ \n",

      "Numbers 23,9. “as I see them from the mountain tops, ‎etc.;” according to Rashi,,  Bileam, viewing Israel’s ‎origin,  understands that the creation of hills and mountains, etc., ‎was all due to G’d wanting a people such as Israel. If He had not ‎foreseen this in the future He would not have bothered with ‎creating our part of the universe. This reminds us of Tanna de ‎bey Eliyahu 14 where the opening line in the Torah reading ‎בראשית ברא אלוקים‎, is understood to mean that on account of ‎Israel, also known as ‎ראשית‎, G’d began the creation of the ‎universe. Had G’d foreseen only gentile nations in the future He ‎would not have bothered creating hills and mountains.‎ \n",

      "Deuteronomy 27,8.  you will inscribe on these stones ‎all these words of the Torah, very clearly.” A look at ‎‎Rashi’s comment on the expression will reveal that he ‎understands this as a translation of the entire Torah into 70 ‎languages.‎[According to Rabbi Eliyahu Mizrachi, foremost super ‎commentary on Rashi, Rashi may have arrived at this ‎interpretation when considering that the letters of the word ‎היטב‎  ‎when converted into what is known as tzeyrufim, ”letter ‎permutation,” ‎ה, הי, היט, היטב‎, add up to a numerical value of 70. ‎Ed.]‎Still, we must try and understand what prompted Moses to ‎command at this point that the Torah be made available in ‎indelible writing (engraved on stone) in all the known languages ‎of that time. We may find the answer in Rashi’s commentary ‎on the very first verse in the Torah, where he said (based on ‎‎Bereshit Rabbah 1,3) that the reason why the Torah ‎commenced with the statement that G’d had created heaven and ‎earth, was so that when an international Court of Law would ‎declare the Israelites’ conquest and subsequent dispossession of ‎the seven Canaanite nations  illegal, we would respond that the ‎Canaanites themselves had claimed territorial rights to an earth ‎that belonged exclusively to G’d who had created it. Surely the ‎owner had the right to re-allocate the earth to tenants of His ‎choosing.‎The whole idea behind G’d’s commandments to take stones ‎from the Jordan river and (erect them near Mount Gerizim) to ‎inscribe in them the Torah in all the known languages was that if ‎the Israelites, at this time, prepared to take possession of the ‎lands of the Canaanites they would do so with the owner’s ‎permission, nay, at the Owner’s instructions. Moreover, this ‎should remind the nations of the world that the reason they were ‎now being dispossessed was because they had refused to accept ‎this very Torah when they had been given the opportunity to ‎accept it. Seeing that the Israelites were the only nation willing to ‎accept the Torah, most of whose commandments can only be ‎observed in the land which up to then had belonged to the ‎Canaanites, the Canaanites were now forced to abandon it or die ‎in the struggle to hang on to it.‎ ‎‎ ‎‎ ‎ \n",

      " The first thing G’d embarked on when creating the material universe was to create heaven and ‎earth.” It is an axiom, general principle, that G’d created the entire universe, and having done so, ‎never withdraws from the universe for even a single moment, [unlike sculptors or painters who, ‎once they have completed a sculpture or painting, move on to something else, having “finished” ‎with their previous “creation.” Ed.] This axiom is true both of what He created in the heavens and ‎what He created in the material, three-dimensional part of the universe. We pay tribute to this in ‎our daily prayers when we say ‎יוצר אור ובורא חושך‎, “He creates and fashions (present tense) light, ‎and He creates darkness.” When speaking of any accomplishments of G’d’s creatures however, we ‎speak of them in the past tense, i.e.‎יצר כסא‎, “he shaped a chair,” or ‎עשה מזרון‎, “he made a ‎mattress.” G’d’s creative activity is never completed, as the Torah testified in Genesis 2,3 ‎אשר ברא ‏אלוקים לעשות‎, “which the Lord has created in order to complete it.” This means that G’d is part of ‎every creature He ever created, and once man realizes that he is nothing without G’d Who has ‎created him and Who provides him with all the strength and creative stimuli that he possesses, he ‎will be able to relate to Hashem as an ongoing creative Force in His universe. This is ‎reflected every morning when we get up [after having used the washroom] and we refer to G’d ‎with the words ‎אשר יצר את האדם בחכמה‎, “Who has fashioned man with ‎חכמה‎,” the word ‎חכמה‎ ‎meaning the opposite of ‎אין‎, “nothing.” It is appropriate therefore that in that prayer we refer to ‎the creation of man in the past tense, as opposed to the line we quoted earlier, seeing that we ‎refer to something or somebody who already exists, i.e. ‎יש‎. This explains why the Ari z’al , ‎Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, said that when we refer to G’d as ‎ה' מלך‎, usually translated as “Hashem ‎‎is King,” the reference is to the ‎אין‎, “nothing,” i.e. G’d at any given moment ‎gives us life, -by not withdrawing it from us.- The implied meaning of the expression is that man is ‎‎“nothing” unless he continues to exist as part of G’d’s creative activity. The so-called ‎אין‎, “nothing,” ‎in terms of metaphysical beings, rules supreme in the regions beyond those that are part of the ‎physical universe, the one that we conveniently refer to as “nature.” This so-called ‎אין‎, is not really ‎a “nothing,” in terms of the universe, its “nothingness” is such only vis a vis the ‎physical part of the universe; in the celestial regions this “‎אין‎” rules supreme. [as opposed to the ‎חכמה‎ in our part of the universe. Ed. Although ‎יש‎ and ‎אין‎ are popularly perceived as absolute ‎opposites, not having anything in common, this perception is built on a fallacy; the linkage between ‎יש‎ and ‎אין‎ are the mitzvot, Torah commandments, performed by the Jewish people. The ‎commandments are performed in the section of the universe known as ‎יש‎, as a result of which ‎close contact is maintained between the aforementioned two domains of the universe. Ezekiel 1:14 refers to the “mitzvot” in their capacity as providing the link between the terrestrial ‎and the celestial part of the universe with the words ‎והחיות רצוא ושוב‎, “and the chayot ran ‎to and fro”. According to the Zohar II 288, the mitzvot and the Torah respectively, ‎are viewed as related to one another like the “hidden” is related to the “revealed,” both being part ‎of the same whole. Torah and mitzvot provide the link between these two domains, so that ‎each domain is not completely divorced from the other. This concept is contained in the letters of ‎the word ‎מצוה‎ when we divide it up into ‎מצ‎ and ‎וה‎. The letters ‎מצ‎ when we read the alphabet ‎backwards, starting with the letter ‎ת‎ are equivalent to the letters ‎יה‎, symbolising the totally ‎abstract Divinity, whereas the letters ‎וה‎ symbolize the hidden parts of the universe, ‎יש‎. The first ‎half of the word ‎מצוה‎ being read with the two letters used in reverse order of the aleph ‎‎bet, alludes to the “hidden” part of the universe, the domain exclusive to Divine, abstract ‎forces. Let us explain something about what precisely is “hidden” and what is “revealed,” when it ‎comes to the ‎מצוה‎, “Torah commandment.” When we perform a ‎מצוה‎, we cause G’d to become ‎pleased with having created man, the choicest of His creatures. When we comply with requests ‎made to us by a fellow human being, we can immediately gauge whether he is pleased by our ‎actions or not, either by his face indicating this, or by words of approval, something that is not the ‎case when we comply with G’d’s requests from us. Since He is invisible, and does not speak to us ‎as He did to Moses, “mouth to mouth”, we have no way of knowing if our efforts to please Him ‎have been successful. When we try to perform deeds that are for our (immediate) personal ‎benefit, we are able to determine if our efforts have succeeded. This then is the “hidden” element ‎present whenever we perform any of G’d’s commandments, ‎מצות‎. This is what the Torah had in ‎mind when it wrote (Deuteronomy 29,28) ‎הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו‎, “the hidden aspects of ‎‎mitzvah performance are reserved for the Lord our G’d;” on the other hand, ‎והנגלות לנו ‏ולבנינו עד עולם‎, “the benefits which the performance of the Torah confers upon us will be ‎revealed forever.” This is also the meaning of the words ‎בראשית ברא אלוקים‎, (addressed to us) “at ‎the beginning of G’d’s creative activity G’d created the ‎יש‎, a physical domain of the universe.” ‎Through His creating ‎יש‎, i.e. ‎ראשית‎, a beginning, the creation of heaven and earth came into being, ‎for prior to that there was only the ‎אין‎, the abstract universe. This is the meaning of Targum ‎‎Yerushalmi who renders this verse as‎ 'בראשית בחוכמא ברא ה‎', “at the beginning G’d created ‎by means of using intelligence found in the domain of the abstract regions.” ‎חכמה‎, as we pointed ‎out earlier, is a quality inherent in the terrestrial domain.‎ \n",

What is the reason, then, that it commences with the account of the Creation? Because of the thought expressed in the text (Psalms 111:6) “He declared to His people the strength of His works (i.e. He gave an account of the work of Creation), in order that He might give them the heritage of the nations.” For should the peoples of the world say to Israel, “You are robbers, because you took by force the lands of the seven nations of Canaan”, Israel may reply to them, “All the earth belongs to the Holy One, blessed be He; He created it and gave it to whom He pleased.

      "בראשית ברא IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED — This verse calls aloud for explanation in the manner that our Rabbis explained it: God created the world for the sake of the Torah which is called (Proverbs 8:22) “The beginning (ראשית) of His (God’s) way”, and for the sake of Israel who are called (Jeremiah 2:3) “The beginning (ראשית) of His (God’s) increase’’. If, however, you wish to explain it in its plain sense, explain it thus: At the beginning of the Creation of heaven and earth when the earth was without form and void and there was darkness, God said, “Let there be light”.  The text does not intend to point out the order of the acts of Creation — to state that these (heaven and earth) were created first; for if it intended to point this out, it should have written 'בראשונה ברא את השמים וגו “At first God created etc.” And for this reason: Because, wherever the word ראשית occurs in Scripture, it is in the construct state. E. g., (Jeremiah 26:1) “In the beginning of (בראשית) the reign of Jehoiakim”; (Genesis 10:10) “The beginning of (ראשית) his kingdom”; (Deuteronomy 18:4) “The first fruit of (ראשית) thy corn.” Similarly here you must translate בראשית ברא אלהים as though it read בראשית ברוא, at the beginning of God’s creating. A similar grammatical construction (of a noun in construct followed by a verb) is: (Hosea 1:2) תחלת דבר ה' בהושע, which is as much as to say, “At the beginning of God’s speaking through Hosea, the Lord said to Hosea.” Should you, however, insist that it does actually intend to point out that these (heaven and earth) were created first, and that the meaning is, “At the beginning of everything He created these, admitting therefore that the word בראשית is in the construct state and explaining the omission of a word signifying “everything” by saying that you have texts which are elliptical, omitting a word, as for example (Job 3:10) “Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb” where it does not explicitly explain who it was that closed the womb; and (Isaiah 8:4) “He shall take away the spoil of Samaria” without explaining who shall take it away; and (Amos 6:12) “Doth he plough with oxen,\" and it does not explicitly state, “Doth a man plough with oxen”; (Isaiah 46:10) “Declaring from the beginning the end,” and it does not explicitly state, “Declaring from the beginning of a thing the end of a thing’ — if it is so (that you assert that this verse intends to point out that heaven and earth were created first), you should be astonished at yourself, because as a matter of fact the waters were created before heaven and earth, for, lo, it is written, (v. 2) “The Spirit of God was hovering on the face of the waters,” and Scripture had not yet disclosed when the creation of the waters took place — consequently you must learn from this that the creation of the waters preceded that of the earth. And a further proof that the heavens and earth were not the first thing created is that the heavens were created from fire (אש) and water (מים), from which it follows that fire and water were in existence before the heavens. Therefore you must admit that the text teaches nothing about the earlier or later sequence of the acts of Creation. \n",
